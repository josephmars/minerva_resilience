The Chinese embassy in Islamabad or the Chinese foreign ministry in Beijing have not commented on the incident yet.\n\nChina is a close ally of Pakistan and has invested heavily in various projects in the South Asian country. But the safety of Chinese nationals working on those projects is often threatened by several armed groups in the region. In 2021, the bombing of a bus in Dasu killed 13 people, nine of them Chinese.\n\nDasu is about 80km (49 miles) further northwest from Besham where Tuesday\u2019s suicide attack happened \u2013 the third such incident in a week.\n\nOn Monday night, separatist fighters attacked a naval airbase in Turbat area in the southwestern province of Balochistan, killing at least one paramilitary soldier. Officials said all five of the assailants were also killed in retaliatory fire.\n\nThe Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which has been behind several attacks on Pakistani and Chinese interests in the region and elsewhere, claimed responsibility for the Turbat attack.\n\nLast week, another BLA attack at Gwadar, a port city in Balochistan, killed two soldiers and eight of the group\u2019s fighters. Gwadar is the centrepiece of the $62bn dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project, Pakistan\u2019s most ambitious infrastructure and investment project in recent years.\n\nIn a statement, President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack on Chinese nationals. \u201cAnti-Pakistani elements will never succeed in harming the Pakistan-China friendship,\u201d he said.\n\nInterior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said \u201cenemies\u201d had targeted the citizens of Pakistan\u2019s \u201cextremely trusted friendly country\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis was not an attack on Chinese citizens but also on Pakistan,\u201d he said.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who assumed power for the second time earlier this month, is expected to visit China next month.",
