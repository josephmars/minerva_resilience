Five Chinese nationals among six killed in suicide bomb attack in Pakistan,['Abid Hussain'],"Attacker rams explosives-laden vehicle into convoy of Chinese engineers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa hours after Baloch rebels attacked a naval base.

Islamabad, Pakistan – Five Chinese nationals and a Pakistani driver have been killed after a suicide attacker rammed his explosive-laden vehicle into their convoy near Besham city in northwest Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

The incident happened on Tuesday when the convoy was on its way from Islamabad to Dasu, the site of a key hydroelectric dam being constructed by a Chinese company, about 270km (167 miles) from the capital.

“Our rescue team has successfully retrieved bodies of four people whereas recovery of two more people is still ongoing,” Bilal Faizi, spokesman for Rescue 1122 group in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, told Al Jazeera.

Rescue officials said the vehicle carrying the Chinese nationals fell in a gorge after the blast and at least two bodies were badly burnt, making their identification difficult.

No armed group has so far claimed responsibility for the attack. The Chinese embassy in Islamabad or the Chinese foreign ministry in Beijing have not commented on the incident yet.

China is a close ally of Pakistan and has invested heavily in various projects in the South Asian country. But the safety of Chinese nationals working on those projects is often threatened by several armed groups in the region. In 2021, the bombing of a bus in Dasu killed 13 people, nine of them Chinese.

Dasu is about 80km (49 miles) further northwest from Besham where Tuesday’s suicide attack happened – the third such incident in a week.

On Monday night, separatist fighters attacked a naval airbase in Turbat area in the southwestern province of Balochistan, killing at least one paramilitary soldier. Officials said all five of the assailants were also killed in retaliatory fire.

The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which has been behind several attacks on Pakistani and Chinese interests in the region and elsewhere, claimed responsibility for the Turbat attack.

Last week, another BLA attack at Gwadar, a port city in Balochistan, killed two soldiers and eight of the group’s fighters. Gwadar is the centrepiece of the $62bn dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project, Pakistan’s most ambitious infrastructure and investment project in recent years.

In a statement, President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack on Chinese nationals. “Anti-Pakistani elements will never succeed in harming the Pakistan-China friendship,” he said.

Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said “enemies” had targeted the citizens of Pakistan’s “extremely trusted friendly country”.

“This was not an attack on Chinese citizens but also on Pakistan,” he said.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who assumed power for the second time earlier this month, is expected to visit China next month.","{'https://news.google.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2023-10-07T152858Z_1330952258_RC21N3A297ZB_RTRMADP_3_PAKISTAN-DAILYLIFE-1711450049.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C513', 'https://news.google.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/rescue-1122-1711451687.jpg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80', 'https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/rescue-1122-1711451687.jpg?resize=1200%2C630', 'https://news.google.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/rescue-gorge-1711451694.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C513', 'https://news.google.com/static/media/aj-footer-logo.bac952ad.svg'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDI0LzMvMjYvZml2ZS1jaGluZXNlLW5hdGlvbmFscy1raWxsZWQtaW4tc3VpY2lkZS1ib21iLWF0dGFjay1pbi1wYWtpc3Rhbi1wb2xpY2XSAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMy8yNi9maXZlLWNoaW5lc2UtbmF0aW9uYWxzLWtpbGxlZC1pbi1zdWljaWRlLWJvbWItYXR0YWNrLWluLXBha2lzdGFuLXBvbGljZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1
Pakistan's second-largest naval air station in Turbat under attack,"['Ht News Desk', 'About The Author', '...View Detail']","Pakistan's second-largest naval air station, PNS Siddique in Turbat, came under attack on Monday, reported local media. The BLA claimed that its fighters infiltrated the airbase. Additionally, Chinese drones are reportedly deployed at this facility. (X)

The Majeed Brigade of the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) has taken responsibility for the assault on the Naval Airbase in Turbat, The Balochistan Post reported.

Hindustan Times - your fastest source for breaking news! Read now.

The Majeed Brigade is critical of China's investments in Balochistan, accusing both China and Pakistan of exploiting the region's resources.

The BLA claimed that its fighters have infiltrated the airbase. Additionally, Chinese drones are reportedly deployed at this facility.

As the situation unfolded, Turbat witnessed a significant increase in military activity, as several helicopters were seen patrolling the skies. Ground reported stated that heavy gunfire and explosions continued for over three hours.

The Frontier Corps blocked numerous major Turbat roads, and a large contingent of the Frontier Corps personnel was reported to have moved towards the naval air base.

The BLA claimed that it killed “over a dozen” Pakistani personnel in the attack. Moreover, the BLA also released an audio clip, allegedly from one of its fighters attacking the PNS Siddique, where the fighter claimed that various vehicles were targeted.

In response to the attack, an emergency was declared at Teaching Hospital Turbat, with all doctors instructed to report for duty immediately by the District Health Officer Kech.

This marked the second attack of the week and the third this year by the BLA Majeed Brigade in Turbat.

Previously, on January 29, the BLA targeted Mach city, followed by an attack on the Military Intelligence headquarters in Gwadar on March 20.

During the March 20 attack in Gwadar, two Pakistani soldiers and eight terrorists were killed in the ensuing confrontation after multiple explosions and gunfire erupted at the Pakistan Gwadar Port Authority Complex.

The Gwadar port, under Chinese control, holds strategic importance in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and is a crucial component of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

The surge in terrorist activities in Pakistan, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, follows the termination of a ceasefire between the government and the banned militant group Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan in November 2022, reported Dawn.","{'https://www.hindustantimes.com/static-content/1y/close_game.svg', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/static-content/1y/cricket-cta-ipl.gif', 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035286&cv=3.6.0&cj=1', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/static-content/1y/ht/search-i1.png', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/static-content/1y/ht/hamburger-i.png', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/03/26/550x309/GJiWqxmW8AAeD1F_1711414127528_1711414139443.jpg', 'https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/148x111.jpg', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/03/26/1600x900/GJiWqxmW8AAeD1F_1711414127528_1711414139443.jpg', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/static-content/1y/ht/1x1.webp', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/static-content/1y/ht/signin-icon2.png', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/static-content/1y/ht/author-default-90x90.webp', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/static-content/1y/ht/crown-icon.png', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/static-content/1y/ht/ht-logo.png'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vd29ybGQtbmV3cy9wYWtpc3RhbnMtc2Vjb25kLWxhcmdlc3QtbmF2YWwtYWlyLXN0YXRpb24taW4tdHVyYmF0LXVuZGVyLWF0dGFjay0xMDE3MTE0MTI5MTg3MDAuaHRtbNIBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vd29ybGQtbmV3cy9wYWtpc3RhbnMtc2Vjb25kLWxhcmdlc3QtbmF2YWwtYWlyLXN0YXRpb24taW4tdHVyYmF0LXVuZGVyLWF0dGFjay0xMDE3MTE0MTI5MTg3MDAtYW1wLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1
Attack on Pakistan naval base results in six killed,[],"Gunmen attacked a Pakistan naval airbase, killing at least one paramilitary soldier, while security forces killed all five of the assailants in retaliatory fire, officials said on Tuesday.

Monday's attack on the Turbat base in southwestern Pakistan was the second assault by ethnic Baloch people on a military facility in the past week.

""We escaped a huge loss,"" said a statement from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's office.

A Pakistan Navy spokesman said all five attackers were killed after they tried to break into the base.

One paramilitary soldier was also killed, according to a military statement.

The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), the most prominent of several separatist groups in Balochistan, claimed responsibility for the assault in a statement.

Previous attacks done by the BLA

The BLA has previously been involved in attacks on Pakistani and Chinese interests in the region and elsewhere.

China has invested heavily in the mineral-rich southwestern province of Balochistan, which borders Afghanistan and Iran, including developing the port of Gwadar, despite a decades-long separatist insurgency.

The naval base is significant to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which also encompasses roads and energy projects and is part of Chinese President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative.

Pakistani security forces said last week they repulsed a gun and bomb attack by the BLA on a complex outside Gwadar, in which two soldiers and all eight gunmen were killed.","{'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/q_auto/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_58,w_58/254834', 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/q_auto/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_58,w_58/390924', 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_537,w_822/587381', 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/v1697435103/Azmaut-logo_nzl3vi.png', 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/Icons/arrow-areucle.svg', 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/q_auto/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_58,w_58/250627', 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/q_auto/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_58,w_58/346878', 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/Icons/profile-user.svg', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1730128020581377&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/Icons/messenger-icon-small.svg', 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/q_auto/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_537,w_822/587380', 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/Icons/mail-icon-small.svg', 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/Icons/twitter-icon-small.svg', 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/q_auto/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_58,w_58/491392', 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_407,w_690/587380', 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/Icons/fb-icon-small.svg', 'https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/Icons/more.svg'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL2FydGljbGUtNzkzNzI20gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1

"Bring Ex Pakistan PM Imran Khan, Wife To Court On April 4, Orders Court",[],"Imran Khan had been implicated in many cases since his removal from government in 2022

A Pakistani court on Monday ordered authorities to present jailed former premier Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi on April 4 during the hearing of their appeal seeking bail in different cases.

District and Session Court judge Tahir Abbas Sipra heard the case on the plea filed by the couple seeking bail in the cases about the forgery of receipts for Toshakhana gifts, while Mr Khan had also filed a petition to seek bail in a May 9 violence case as well.

The order was issued after the Adiala jail officials failed to mark Mr Khan's attendance through a video link for which the order was issued at the last hearing.

Last week, another district and sessions court approved a request seeking to produce Khan and PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi in court, directing authorities to ensure the politicians' production on April 20.

The petition, requesting their production, was heard by Judicial Magistrate Mureed Abbas about the Parliament attack case against Mr Khan and others.

Mr Khan had been implicated in dozens of cases since his removal from government in April 2022.

He has already been convicted in at least four cases. His wife is a co-accused in two of them.

'I cheated on her': India-Pakistan lesbian couple break up weeks before wedding,[],"Social media influencers Anjali Chakra from India and Sufi Malik from Pakistan announced the end of their relationship and called off their upcoming wedding over the weekend. The couple, who went viral in 2019 for their vibrant celebration of South Asian culture, shared the news of their split on Instagram, pointing to infidelity on Sufi's part as the cause.

Anjali and Sufi's journey began over five years ago, which celebrated the beautiful portrayal of love that transcended borders and cultural norms. Their engagement, which took place a year prior to their split, was nothing short of a fairy tale. Sufi proposed to Anjali at the iconic Empire State Building in New York, a moment they joyously shared with their followers through a video post.

However, the dream came to an abrupt end when Sufi admitted to cheating on Anjali just weeks before their wedding.

""I made an unrecognisable mistake of betrayal by cheating on her a few weeks before our wedding. I've hurt her tremendously, beyond my understanding. I am owning up to my mistake and will continue to do so. I've hurt the people I love and care about the most through my actions, including our family and friends; our community that I cherish,"" Sufi wrote in her Instagram post.

""This may come as a shock, but our journey is shifting. We have decided to call off our wedding and end our relationship due to infidelity committed by Sufi,"" read Anjali’s post.

Sufi Malik and Anjali Chakra, the Muslim-Hindu same-sex couple from the US, went viral for their stunning couple photoshoot in 2019.

Meanwhile, Malik admitted to cheating on Chakra shortly before their wedding, acknowledging the pain she has caused and vowing to take responsibility for her actions.

""I made an unrecognisable mistake of betrayal by cheating on her a few weeks before our wedding. I've hurt her tremendously, beyond my understanding. I am owning up to my mistake and will continue to do so,” she wrote on her Instagram page on the same day.

Seeking privacy and respect, Malik said she has “hurt the people I love and care about the most through my actions, including my family and friends.”

In 2019, a series of photographs from a widely appreciated photoshoot showcased the couple adorned in traditional attire, sharing laughter and kisses under a rain-speckled umbrella. The pictures swiftly captivated the internet, earning widespread praise as they symbolised breaking of both gender and religious divides.

The couple also shares a YouTube channel which has over 1.36 lakh subscribers. They regularly posted videos until two months ago.

Malik went down on her knees, offering a ring to Chakra.","{'https://www.hindustantimes.com/static-content/1y/close_game.svg', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/static-content/1y/cricket-cta-ipl.gif', 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035286&cv=3.6.0&cj=1', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/static-content/1y/ht/search-i1.png', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/static-content/1y/ht/hamburger-i.png', 'https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/148x111.jpg', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/03/25/550x309/_849ba47c-b44c-11e9-895a-bbf3eb4ef5e5_1711348273123.jpg', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/static-content/1y/ht/1x1.webp', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/static-content/1y/ht/signin-icon2.png', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/static-content/1y/ht/crown-icon.png', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/static-content/1y/ht/ht-logo.png', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/03/25/1600x900/_849ba47c-b44c-11e9-895a-bbf3eb4ef5e5_1711348273123.jpg'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vdHJlbmRpbmcvYW5qYWxpLWNoYWtyYS1hbmQtc3VmaS1tYWxpay1pbmRpYS1wYWtpc3Rhbi1zYW1lLXNleC1jb3VwbGUtYW5ub3VuY2Utc3BsaXQtaS1jaGVhdGVkLW9uLWhlci0xMDE3MTEzNDcyMjQ3NTguaHRtbNIBnAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vdHJlbmRpbmcvYW5qYWxpLWNoYWtyYS1hbmQtc3VmaS1tYWxpay1pbmRpYS1wYWtpc3Rhbi1zYW1lLXNleC1jb3VwbGUtYW5ub3VuY2Utc3BsaXQtaS1jaGVhdGVkLW9uLWhlci0xMDE3MTEzNDcyMjQ3NTgtYW1wLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1
Suicide Bomber Kills 5 Chinese Workers in Pakistan,"['Salman Masood', 'Christina Goldbaum']","Five Chinese workers were killed on Tuesday when a suicide bomber rammed a vehicle into their convoy in northern Pakistan, the latest in a string of terrorist attacks highlighting the security challenges Pakistan faces in protecting Chinese personnel.

The Chinese laborers were working on the Dasu dam, a hydropower project on the Indus River in the northwestern province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. The convoy was moving to Dasu from Islamabad and came under attack around 1 p.m., officials said.

Over the past week, terrorist attacks also struck a Pakistani military air base and a strategic port in the southwest of the country, where China has invested billions in infrastructure projects. The string of attacks has challenged the close economic and strategic ties between the two countries.

China is estimated to have spent some $62 billion on projects in Pakistan, mostly to build a transportation corridor through Baluchistan to a new Chinese-operated deepwater port in the Pakistani town of Gwadar.","{'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/03/26/multimedia/26pakistan-01-tcjf/26pakistan-01-tcjf-facebookJumbo.jpg', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/03/26/multimedia/26pakistan-01-tcjf/26pakistan-01-tcjf-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDMvMjYvd29ybGQvYXNpYS9wYWtpc3Rhbi1zdWljaWRlLWJvbWJlci1jaGluZXNlLXdvcmtlcnMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1
Pakistan: 5 Chinese workers killed in bombing – DW – 03,[],"A convoy of Chinese engineers was targeted by an attacker driving an explosive-laden vehicle, according to local authorities.

Authorities in Pakistan said on Tuesday that five Chinese nationals were among six people killed in a suicide attack in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Regional police chief Mohammad Ali Gandapur said a convoy carrying Chinese engineers was targeted by a suicide bomber who rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into them.

""Five Chinese nationals and their Pakistani driver were killed in the attack,"" Gandapur told news agencies.

What we know about the attack

The senior police official said the victims had been traveling from Islamabad to their camp in Dasu in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province — which is the site of the Dasu hydroelectric dam, currently being constructed by the China Gezhouba Group Company.

The attack took place along a winding, mountainous road that runs alongside a deep ravine.

In 2021, a bus transporting engineers to the same site was targeted in an attack that killed 13 people, including nine Chinese nationals.

China calls for 'thorough investigation'

China said it ""strongly condemned this terrorist act"" while offering its condolences to the families of the deceased.

""The Chinese embassy and consulates in Pakistan have immediately launched emergency work, demanding that the

Pakistani side conduct a thorough investigation into the attack,"" China's diplomatic mission in Pakistan said in a statement.

It also called for the perpetrators of the attack to be severely punished and for steps to be taken to protect Chinese citizens.

China has invested heavily in Pakistan's infrastructure over the past few years as part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

The Chinese projects have led to a level of resentment in some local quarters, with separatist groups claiming those from the region benefit little, with most jobs going to outsiders.

No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Islamist militants linked to the Pakistani Taliban, known as the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), have previously targeted Chinese interests in Pakistan.

The Taliban regime in Kabul said the Pakistani strikes had, in fact, killed five women and three children.

The Pakistani foreign ministry said terrorists belonging to the TTP’s Hafiz Gul Bahadur group were targeted after the outfit claimed responsibility for the March 16 attack on an army outpost in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in which seven personnel, including two officers, were killed.

The Pakistani military said the attack in North Waziristan was carried out by terrorists who had “safe haven” across the border in Afghanistan, and alleged that the “recent wave of terrorism has the full support and assistance of Afghanistan”.

The Pakistan Foreign Office said that over the past two years, it had “repeatedly conveyed its serious concerns to the interim Afghan government over the presence of terror outfits”.

On his part, the spokesperson for the Kabul regime, Zabiullah Mujahid, said, “The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan does not allow anyone to compromise security by using Afghan territory.”

The Pakistani Taliban

The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan was set up in 2007 as an umbrella group of several militant outfits with the aim of imposing a strict version of Islam on the country.

The TTP has ideological linkages with the Afghan Taliban, whom the Pakistani security establishment had nurtured for many years. Pakistan had expected that the regime that came to power in Kabul in August 2021 would stop the use of Afghan soil against Pakistan by expelling TTP operatives.

However, Pakistan says Kabul has refused to rein in the TTP. The country’s Special Representative to Afghanistan Ambassador Asif Durrani said on March 16 that some 5,000-6,000 TTP militants have taken shelter in Afghanistan.

The American bombing of Afghanistan in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 drove the original Taliban leadership in Kandahar to Quetta, capital of Pakistan’s Balochistan province, where the hardline Islamist movement gained more cadres and newer leaders.

“Contrary to popular perception that the Pakistani Taliban movement emerged after the 11 September attacks, the movement was in fact already active in Afghanistan and only returned home after the demise of the Afghan regime,” the journalist Abubakar Siddique wrote in his book The Pashtun Question: The Unresolved Key to the Future of Pakistan and Afghanistan (2014).

While the leadership and the majority of Taliban cadre were from Waziristan, the movement attracted followers and allies from across Pakistan’s Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, the eastern Punjab province, and the southern Sindh province, Siddique wrote.

Terrorist attacks in Pak

The Pakistani government blamed the TTP for the December 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, and the US CIA confirmed in January 2008 that it believed the TTP was involved. The TTP denied the accusation.

“At the zenith of its power, the TTP’s extended network sometimes controlled large swaths of territory in north-western Pakistan. Baitullah Mehsud, the founding leader of the TTP, appeared on Time Magazine’s Time 100 list of the world’s most influential people in 2008. But his August 2009 death in a US drone strike precipitated the TTP’s decline,” Siddique wrote.

Among the many attacks the TTP has claimed over the years, two stand out: the school-bus shooting of Malala Yousafzai, the winner of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize who was then a young activist blogger, and two other schoolgirls in October 2012; and the attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar in December 2014, in which 132 schoolchildren between the ages of eight and 18, and nine school staff, were massacred.

‘Snakes in backyard’

Pakistan’s frustration with the Afghan Taliban’s refusal to act against the TTP reminds many in New Delhi and elsewhere of former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s observation that Pakistan could not nurture snakes with the expectation that they would only bite its enemies.

In 2011, Clinton said at a joint news conference with then Pakistan Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar: “It’s like that old story — you can’t keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbours. Eventually those snakes are going to turn on whoever has them in the backyard.”

In 2014-15, the Pakistan armed forces carried out Operation Zarb-e-Azb, an expansive operation against militants including the TTP in the country’s north west, killing an estimated 3,500 insurgents.

“For India and Afghanistan, military strikes against the TTP confirmed further that the Pakistan Army did have the capacity to act against terrorists but it was selective in doing so and clearly excluding from its action groups which targeted India and Afghanistan,” the former Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan, T C A Raghavan, wrote in his book, The People Next Door: The Curious History of India’s Relations with Pakistan (2017)

In an article published in the Pakistani daily Dawn on March 20, Zahid Hussain, a leading commentator, pointed to evidence that the Afghan Taliban were involved with the TTP in conducting cross-border attacks on Pakistan, and expressed concern over the potential use of modern weapons left behind by NATO and the former Afghan army.

Hussain noted that given their old connections and ideological proximity, the Afghan Taliban would not take action against their fellow jihadists.

“There is no doubt that the Afghan Taliban’s return to power has been a major contributory factor in the revival of terrorist violence in Pakistan. However, the absence of a coherent strategy on Pakistan’s part has also allowed the TTP to claw back some lost space…Indeed, the policy of appeasement has come back to haunt us,” Hussain wrote.

For New Delhi, this is a we-told-you-so moment. It would want Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Army Chief General Asim Munir to take concrete steps over the next few months against all terror outfits irrespective of their motivation, so that a possible window for a dialogue with New Delhi is opened.","{'https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/ie-express-shorts/assets/images/short-header.svg',

Suicide Bombing Kills 5 Chinese Citizens in Pakistan,['Ayaz Gul'],"Police in northern Pakistan said Tuesday that at least five Chinese nationals and their local driver were killed when a suicide bomber rammed his explosives-laden car into their convoy.

The attack occurred on the main highway linking Pakistan to China.

Beijing swiftly denounced what it called a terrorist attack and demanded Pakistani authorities bring the perpetrators to justice.

Local police officer Bakht Zahir told VOA an investigation into the ""suicide blast"" was underway.

No group immediately claimed responsibility for one of the deadliest attacks on Chinese nationals in recent years.

Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack and conveyed his condolences to the victims’ families and the government in neighboring China.

""Forces hostile to Pakistan will never succeed in damaging the Pakistan-China friendship,"" Zardari said.

The victims were traveling to the Chinese-funded Dasu hydropower project under construction in the district of Kohistan when the bomber coming from the opposite side hit them.

In a statement, the Chinese Embassy in Islamabad demanded that the Pakistani government immediately conduct a thorough investigation into the deadly bombing.

The diplomatic mission urged Pakistani authorities to “take practical and effective measures to protect the safety of Chinese citizens, institutions, and projects to prevent such incidents from happening again.”



Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the Chinese Embassy to offer condolences over the death of Chinese nationals in the suicide attack, his office said.

This is not the first time Chinese nationals have come under attack in the mountainous region.

In mid-2021, a suicide car bombing targeted a bus convoy of Chinese engineers working on the biggest hydropower project in Pakistan, killing nine Chinese nationals and three of their local co-workers.

Thousands of Chinese engineers and laborers are working in Pakistan. Most of them are associated with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC, which is an extension of Beijing’s global Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure program.

“Today’s attack was orchestrated by the enemies of Pakistan-China friendship. We will resolutely act against all such forces and defeat them,” the Pakistani foreign ministry said in a statement. “Pakistan will continue to work with our Chinese brothers in ensuring the safety and security of Chinese nationals, projects, and institutions in Pakistan.”

Mushahid Hussain, the head of the Islamabad-based independent Pakistan-China Institute, described Tuesday’s attack as a “monumental security breach.” The former Pakistani senator criticized his government in comments posted on X, saying Islamabad’s commitments to provide ‘foolproof security’ to Chinese workers “ring hollow” in the wake of repeated high-profile attacks on them.

Tuesday’s attack came a day after separatist insurgents stormed Pakistan’s second-largest naval aviation base in southwestern Baluchistan province. The military said that security forces killed all four assailants, and a Pakistani soldier died in the ensuing clashes.

The so-called Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), designated as a global terrorist organization by the United States, took responsibility for the attack.

Last week, eight heavily armed insurgents stormed a government compound in Baluchistan’s Gwadar district, home to a China-operated port. The ensuing gunfight killed all the assailants and left several Pakistani security personnel dead. The BLA claimed its fighters carried out the raid.

The deep-water Gwadar port is located near the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial oil shipping route in the Arabian Sea. It is run by a Chinese state company and is a centerpiece of the multibillion-dollar bilateral CPEC collaboration.","{'https://gdb.voanews.com/D524053E-1C40-4504-92AE-FF27C79EE6FE.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-1129-08dc4dbc1c20_w160_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-6196-08dc4d99b9b1_w250_r1_s.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-5eea-08dc4d86d08a_w250_r0_s.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/Content/responsive/VOA/en-US/img/logo.svg', 'https://news.google.com/Content/responsive/VOA/en-US/img/logo-compact.svg', 'https://news.google.com/Content/responsive/VOA/en-US/img/logo-print_color.png', 'https://news.google.com/Content/responsive/img/player-spinner.png', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-f333-08dc4d199c6a_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-a614-08dc4d99b9c9_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/A9502BF0-4571-446A-937D-5980A5D56BE2_w100_r1.png', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-a614-08dc4d99b9c9_w250_r1_s.jpg', 'https://bbg.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/b/ss/bbgrvoaenglish-bbgprod-bbgentityvoa-bbgunitvoaenglish/1/G.4--NS/568383188?pageName=voa%3aeng%3ar%3aarticle%3asuicide%20bombing%20kills%205%20chinese%20citizens%20in%20pakistan%20%0a&c6=suicide%20bombing%20kills%205%20chinese%20citizens%20in%20pakistan%20%0a&pangea_version=8.30.0.0.275&v6=D=c6&g=https%3a%2f%2fwww.voanews.com&c1=D=g&v1=D=g&events=event1&c7=suicide%20bombing%20kills%205%20chinese%20citizens%20in%20pakistan%20%0a&v7=D=c7&c16=voa%20english&v16=D=c16&c5=s_south-central-asia&v5=D=c5&ch=english&v15=D=ch&c15=D=ch&c4=article&v4=D=c4&c14=7542877&v14=D=c14&c20=no&c17=responsive&v17=D=c17', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-f719-08dc48fe5e4e_cx0_cy12_cw0_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/Content/responsive/VOA/en-US/img/logo-print.gif'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2Evc3VpY2lkZS1ib21iaW5nLWtpbGxzLTUtY2hpbmVzZS1uYXRpb25hbHMtaW4tcGFraXN0YW4tLzc1NDI4NzcuaHRtbNIBX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9zdWljaWRlLWJvbWJpbmcta2lsbHMtNS1jaGluZXNlLW5hdGlvbmFscy1pbi1wYWtpc3Rhbi0vNzU0Mjg3Ny5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1

PESHAWAR, Pakistan - Five Chinese nationals were killed in an explosion when their convoy was attacked by a suicide bomber in northwestern Pakistan on Tuesday, a senior police officer said.

A suicide bomber rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into the convoy of Chinese engineers that was on its way from Islamabad to their camp in the Shangla area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Mohammad Ali Gandapur, the regional police chief, told Reuters.

“Five Chinese nationals and their Pakistani driver were killed in the attack,” Gandapur said.

Another police officer in the region, Naveed Ahmed, said the foreign citizens were heading to Dasu in a convoy of at least 12 vehicles when the attack happened.

Dasu is the site of a major dam and the area has been attacked in the past. A blast on a bus had killed 13 people, including nine Chinese nationals, in 2021.

The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police had reached the spot and started relief operations. The rest of the people in the convoy have been protected, Gandapur said.

Pakistan has seen a resurgence in militant attacks since August 2021 when the Taliban took over in neighbouring Afghanistan, emboldening other groups like the local offshoot, Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.

Pakistan recorded 586 attacks last year, 55% more than in the previous year, according to Islamabad-based Center for Research & Security Studies.

The militants have targeted Chinese workers, prompting condemnation from Beijing and calls for Pakistan to strengthen its security of Chinese companies operating in the South Asian nation.

Last week an attack near the Chinese-operated Gwadar port complex in the southwestern Balochistan province resulted in the deaths of eight militants.

Pakistan’s Interior Ministry condemned the suicide attack on Tuesday and vowed a “strong retaliation”.

“The enemy has targeted the citizens of Pakistan’s most trusted friend,” the ministry said in a statement. “This was not an attack on Chinese nationals but on Pakistan.”

The attacks come as newly installed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif plans to revive work on the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, an infrastructure network of roads, railways and ports.

Addressing a ceremony in Islamabad on Tuesday, Sharif said industries would be set up across Pakistan under the second phase of the corridor project to revive the battered economy.","{'https://static.bangkokpost.com/v3/assets/images/icon/arrow.svg', 'https://static.bangkokpost.com/v3/assets/images/icon/icon_facebook_black.svg', 'https://static.bangkokpost.com/v3/assets/images/icon/icon_tiktok.svg', 'https://static.bangkokpost.com/v3/assets/images/icon/icon_facebook.svg', 'https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20240326/c1_2765558_700.jpeg', 'https://static.bangkokpost.com/v3/assets/images/icon/icon_rss.svg', 'https://static.bangkokpost.com/v3/assets/images/icon/icon_tiktok_black.svg', 'https://static.bangkokpost.com/v3/assets/images/icon/icon_instagram.svg', 'https://static.bangkokpost.com/v3/assets/images/icon/icon_line.svg', 'https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20240326/c1_2765558.jpeg', 'https://static.bangkokpost.com/v3/assets/images/icon/icon_twitter.svg?v=0.1', 'https://static.bangkokpost.com/v3/assets/images/logo/bp-logo.svg', 'https://static.bangkokpost.com/v3/assets/images/icon/icon_twitter_black.svg?v=0.1', 'https://static.bangkokpost.com/v3/assets/images/icon/icon_instagram_black.svg', 'https://static.bangkokpost.com/v3/assets/images/logo/postgroup-logo_white.svg', 'https://static.bangkokpost.com/v3/assets/images/icon/icon_search_white.svg', 'https://static.bangkokpost.com/v3/assets/images/icon/icon_search_blue.svg'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmdrb2twb3N0LmNvbS93b3JsZC8yNzY1NTU4L3Bha2lzdGFuLXN1aWNpZGUtYm9tYi1raWxscy01LWNoaW5lc2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1

"5 Chinese engineers killed in suicide bomb attack in Pakistan, probe under way",['Umar Bacha'],"The bodies of the six victims were recovered after the fire on board the wrecked bus was extinguished.

The force of the blast also killed the Pakistani driver of the bus, hurling it down a gorge onto the banks of the Indus River, said Sheraz Khan, station head of the official Rescue 1122 emergency service.

A bus carrying the Chinese engineers to work at the Dasu hydropower project on Tuesday was struck near the town of Besham on the Karakoram Highway , the sole overland link between Pakistan and China , officials said.

Five Chinese nationals have been killed in a vehicular suicide bombing attack in northern Pakistan that echoed a similar attack in the area in July 2021.

The victims had been identified as employees of Wuhan-based engineering firm China Gezhouba Group Co., said Rehmat Ali, a Dasu project official.

The bus was travelling in a convoy of a dozen vehicles, most of them carrying security personnel guarding the Chinese nationals, when it was struck.

No terrorist group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack.

It was the third major attack on Chinese interests in Pakistan in a week, after an airbase and a port were hit in the province of Balochistan.

Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has condemned the attack, saying Islamabad would carry on its fight against militants.

In July 2021, nine Chinese nationals working on the World Bank-funded Dasu project were killed in a vehicular suicide bombing.

Local resident Muhammad Hayat Khan said he was at home on Tuesday preparing for afternoon prayers when he heard two explosions.

Upon reaching the nearby highway, he found the burning remains of the bomber’s vehicle and the bus that was targeted.

Besham police chief Juma Rehman said an investigation had been launched.

“We will investigate from where and how the vehicle of the suicide bomber came and how it happened,” he said.

In a statement, Pakistan’s military described the terrorist attacks in Besham and Balochistan province as “dastardly acts aimed at destabilising the internal security situation”.

Addressing the killing of the five Chinese nationals in Besham, it said: “The whole nation stands in solidarity with our Chinese brothers and unequivocally condemn this cowardly act.”

The statement issued by Inter Services Public Relations said “strategic projects and sensitive sites” vital for Pakistan’s economic progress and the well-being of its people were being targeted “as a conscious effort to retard our progress and sow discord between Pakistan and its strategic allies and partners, most notably China”.

Pakistan’s military, which is responsible for the security of Chinese nationals working in the country, vowed to hold the perpetrators of the Besham attack accountable “with the unwavering support of … our ironclad ally China”.

“Together we will prevail over adversity and evil,” it added.

China’s embassy in Islamabad called on Pakistan to “thoroughly investigate the attack and severely punish the perpetrators” of the Besham attack.

In a statement, the embassy said it had activated an “emergency plan” under which “all necessary measures” were being taken to protect the safety of Chinese citizens, institutions and projects in Pakistan, and to “ensure such incidents will not happen again”.

It did provide any details.

The embassy reminded Chinese citizens and enterprises in Pakistan to “pay close attention to the security situation, enhance security alerts, strengthen security measures, and make every effort to take safety precautions”.

Farwa Aamer, director of South Asia Initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute in New York, said the Besham attack “highlights the persistent security risks faced” both by Pakistan and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

“These security concerns have long impeded CPEC’s progress, and the recent series of attacks further exacerbate these worries,” she said.

The onus was now on Pakistan’s new government to urgently address these challenges to “ensure the continuity and sustainability of the project and the larger Sino-Pakistan relationship, especially amid the backdrop of grave economic challenges”, Aamer said.

China has invested more than US$28 billion in infrastructure projects in Pakistan as part of the wider Belt and Road Initiative , with Chinese engineers typically working alongside their Pakistani counterparts under heavy security.

The latest attack comes a week before Prime Minister Shebaz Sharif is expected to make his first overseas official visit to Beijing since the Pakistani general election last month.

Sharif visited the Chinese embassy in Islamabad to personally express his condolences to Ambassador Jiang Zaidong.

"Pakistan suicide bomb attack: Five Chinese nationals, local driver killed en route to Dasu",[],"Pakistan Suicide Bomb Attack : Five Chinese nationals and their Pakistani driver were killed after a suicide bomber rammed an explosives-laden car into the vehicle carrying Chinese engineers and workers. This is the third such attack in the last few weeks in Pakistan.

The incident took place on in Shangla district in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Bakhat Zahir, local police chief, quoted by news agency AFP said that those killed were construction workers and engineers heading to the Dasu Dam. It is the biggest hydropower project in Pakistan. The bodies have been transported to a nearby hospital.

The security froces have launched a search operation in the area to look for the attackers, the report said. The Pakistani Taliban has been increasing attacks on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province which borders Afghanistan.

Last week, eight “Baluchistan Liberation Army"" militants were killed by Pakistani security forces after they opened fire on a convoy carrying Chinese citizens outside the Gwadar port. The port is Chinese-funded and is located in the southwestern Baluchistan province.

The BLA militants want independence from the Pakistani government.

In a statement, the country's interior minister Mohsin Naqvi offered condolences to the families of the deceased.

He said, ""The enemy has targeted Chinese citizens who are the friends of Pakistan."" He did not elaborate who he was referring to but vowed to ""deal with an iron hand"" those responsible, and expressed hope the attack wouldn't negatively impact Pakistani-Chinese relations.

Naqvi also visited China's embassy in Islamabad, where he briefed the Chinese ambassador, Jiang Zaidong, about the attack. Naqvi also promised a full investigation.

The report by AFP said that thousands of Chinese nationals work on projects related to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. The CPEC includes several projects like as road construction, power plants and agriculture. Experts consider CPEC as a lifeline for Pakistan's cash-strapped economy. The CPEC is a part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative.

However, several Chinese laborers who are working on projects related to CPEC have been facing increased attacks in recent years.

In July 2021, at least 13 people, were killed in a suicide attack. Out of these, nine were Chinese nationals.

""The Chinese Embassy and Consulates General in Pakistan have launched an emergency plan immediately, requesting the Pakistani side to thoroughly investigate the attack and severely punish the perpetrators...(we) are taking all necessary measures to protect the safety of Chinese citizens, institutions and projects in Pakistan, and to ensure such incidents will not happen again.""

Attack on Chinese interests in Pakistan

Beijing has invested billions in infrastructure projects as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), and several Chinese engineers have been working on a number of projects in the South Asian country.

Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari took to X and strongly condemned the attack and offered condolences to the families of the Chinese nationals and Beijing’s government.

He added that those who are hostile to Pakistan will “never succeed in harming Pak-China friendship”.

The attacks also come ahead of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s visit to China, reported Reuters citing a source in the PM’s Office.

The first two attacks on Chinese interests this week included the targeting of an airbase and a strategic port in the southwest province of Balochistan.

The reportedly deadly attack on Pakistan’s second-largest naval air station, the PNS Siddique in Turbat took place earlier on Tuesday (Mar 26) the responsibility of which was claimed by the Majeed Brigade of the Balochistan Liberation Army, a proscribed separatist militant organisation based in Afghanistan.

The attack on the naval air station was marked by intense gunfire and multiple explosions.","{'https://news.google.com/assets/images/twitter.svg?v=6.00', 'data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27880%27%20height=%27485%27/%3e', 'https://cdn.wionews.com/images/2022/UGC_Banner_600x50.png?imwidth=1200', 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7', 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9254297&cv=2.0&cj=1', 'https://cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2024/03/26/420954-wion-images-2024-03-26t162719653.png?imwidth=400', 'data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27600%27%20height=%2750%27/%3e', 'https://news.google.com/assets/images/fb.svg?v=6.00', 'https://news.google.com/assets/images/in.svg?v=6.00', 'https://cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/2024/03/26/420954-wion-images-2024-03-26t162719653.png', 'https://news.google.com/assets/images/whtsapp.svg?v=6.00'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53aW9uZXdzLmNvbS93b3JsZC9hdC1sZWFzdC1maXZlLWNoaW5lc2UtbmF0aW9uYWxzLWxvY2FsLWRyaXZlci1raWxsZWQtaW4tc3VpY2lkZS1ib21iLWF0dGFjay1pbi1wYWtpc3Rhbi1yZXBvcnRzLTcwNDM3N9IBhwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53aW9uZXdzLmNvbS93b3JsZC9hdC1sZWFzdC1maXZlLWNoaW5lc2UtbmF0aW9uYWxzLWxvY2FsLWRyaXZlci1raWxsZWQtaW4tc3VpY2lkZS1ib21iLWF0dGFjay1pbi1wYWtpc3Rhbi1yZXBvcnRzLTcwNDM3Ny9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1

DERA ISLAMIL KHAN, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistan security forces killed four insurgents in an overnight raid on a militant hideout in the country’s northwest bordering Afghanistan, the military said Tuesday.

Troops found a cache of weapons, ammunition, and explosives in the intelligence-based operation conducted at the hideout in Dera Ismail Khan, a district in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, the military said in a statement.

Though security forces often conduct such raids, the latest one came hours after insurgents from an outlawed Baluchistan Liberation Army or BLA tried to sneak into a navy air base in Baluchistan province.

A soldier and four attackers were killed in the ensuing shootout in Turbat district, the military said on Tuesday. No damage was caused to the Siddiqui air station.

BLA claimed responsibility for the attack. The group was designated a terrorist group by Pakistan, the United Kingdom and the United States years ago.","{'https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/o8n1yd_igjVmT9BQ32L7Xg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTUyO2g9NjA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/9b2f0f90-355f-11eb-bef3-afd1c608253f', 'https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/nN3KkHw2SQS9MAR__kErkg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/cab53d70fb5741b211f9914bb823d232', 'https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif', 'https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190724/yahoo-news-logo-2019.svg', 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7241469&c5=1197618800&c7=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Fpakistani-security-forces-kill-4-062958543.html&c14=-1', 'https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190501/placeholder.gif', 'https://s.yimg.com/dv/static/siteApp/img/privacy-choice-control.png', 'https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190724/app-store-icon@3x.png', 'https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190724/google-play-icon@3x.png', 'https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/fmoUoUzAgAqYoGrYDlV9yw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/cab53d70fb5741b211f9914bb823d232'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL3Bha2lzdGFuaS1zZWN1cml0eS1mb3JjZXMta2lsbC00LTA2Mjk1ODU0My5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1

"Gold market distortions create different problems in Poland, Thailand and Pakistan",[],"(Kitco News) – White-hot gold prices are resulting in a range of disparities and distortions in local precious metals markets around the world, according to various recent reports.

In Central and Eastern Europe, the rising risk premium on savings since the Russian invasion of Ukraine has actually served to drive down investor interest in the ultimate flight-to-safety asset, with gold demand seeing a 42% year-over year decline.

“Mennica Skarbowa, the largest dealer of investment gold and other precious metals in Poland, closed in 2023 with revenues 42 percent lower than in 2022,” Polish news outlet WBJ reported. “This result is consistent with the decline in gold demand recorded in this part of Europe (down 42 percent y/y).”

The report said this resulted from banks in the region raising the average interest rate on deposits and “favorable savings products,” along with high rates of inflation.

“The high cost of living for Poles and Europeans meant a decrease in the number of free funds allocated for precious metal purchases,” they wrote, “and record-high gold prices encouraged primarily the resale of accumulated bars and coins.”

Meanwhile, in Thailand, local gold prices set three consecutive all-time highs in a single day on March 21, underlining the steep upward trend which has seen the yellow metal gain more than 25 percent since the end of 2022.

“This has never happened before in history, especially as it is only 3 months into the year and the price has already risen by more than 10 percent,” Jitti Tangsitpakdee, President of the Gold Traders Association, told local media outlet Khaosod.

Tangsitpakdee said the sustained uptrend was being driven not only by the prospect of central bank rate cuts, but also by continuous local buying of physical bullion.

According to the Thai Ministry of Commerce, this period of skyrocketing gold prices has also contributed to an unprecedented surge in counterfeit gold, including both gold bars and jewelry, with over 1,600 cases reported in 2023.

Deputy Minister of Commerce Naphinthorn Srisanphan said that ministry “has commissioned the Gem and Jewelry Institute of Thailand (GIT) to test the purity of precious metals and the purity of gold using ultrasonic waves that do not damage the workpiece.”

Under the Buy With Confidence (BWC) project, the GIT will issue a quality certificate to prospective buyers and sellers upon demand. The Ministry also works with government agencies such as the Consumer Protection Bureau and the Domestic Trade Department to fight the counterfeiting.

The Ministry of Commerce also warned the public against buying gold through online channels, where there is a greater risk of gold counterfeiting, and they reminded gold sellers that they must strictly abide by the law, including clearly displaying the price tag for gold and bullion products.

“Selling goods at an unreasonably high price, hoarding goods or refusing to sell them is punishable by imprisonment of up to seven years or a fine of up to 140,000 baht [$3,846], or both,” the report said. “Using a scale that has not been certified by the Department of Internal Trade is punishable by up to six months’ imprisonment or a fine of up to [$549], or both. Tampering with the weighing elements of the scale is punishable by imprisonment of up to 7 years or a fine of up to [$7,692].”

And in Pakistan, the ongoing crackdown on speculation and smuggling within the jewelry industry that began in September appears to have had no positive effects other than daily bullion rate announcements being published earlier in the day.

According to a report from local media Dawn, “a series of commitments made by the bullion trade representatives to law enforcement agencies to increase the sector’s transparency remain unfulfilled.”

Between Sept. 13 to Oct. 10 last year, the All Pakistan Gem and Jewellers Association (APGJA) halted the publication of daily gold prices after the arrest of five jewelers accused of illegal activities.

Following negotiations between law enforcement agencies and the head of the APGJA, the traders were released with assurances from the Association that they would “help control speculation, encourage physical trading, promote legal trading practices, and enhance documentation and computerization” within the local gold market.

The release of daily gold exchange rates “remained disrupted until the third week of October, and inconsistency in gold pricing posed significant challenges for consumers,” the report said. “Some upcountry-based bullion traders began setting their rates independently despite mutual understanding that prices all over Pakistan should be uniform based on the rupee-dollar parity in the interbank market instead of the open market.”

The Dawn report said that “despite the APGJA’s assurances, implementing measures promised to law enforcement agencies has largely remained theoretical,” and that “trade practices within the sector continue to be opaque, with dealers often not providing receipts for transactions and asking sellers to show old cash memos of their gold-related items.”

They said that some traders misrepresent the quality and purity of their gold, and others have set up “mini shops outside their outlets to deal with people looking for smaller transactions” which ignore the requirement to adhere to the fixed price, while hardly any traders are “integrated with the Federal Board of Revenue’s point-of-sale (POS) system.”

Mohammad Haseen Qureshi, President of the All Karachi Jewellers and Manufacturers Association, called for “establishing a dedicated authority comprising bullion market representatives” to address the ongoing issues in the gold market.

“This entity would oversee daily rate issuance, quality control and monitor speculative and black-market activities in gold trading,” the report said. “The authority would also facilitate the resolution of disputes with the FBR and other government bodies and reassure consumers regarding tax and duty compliance among traders.”","{'https://images.kitco.com/img/height_170,width_304/icms/67b3eb1a-ebc6-41bb-b0d3-a9a2a8b45178.jpeg', 'https://image-api.prod.kitco.com/image/378c2c9a-82a0-4231-97ad-ec8669d06569.jpeg?top=0&left=2.4502297090352&width=5755.0995405819&height=3240&scale_width=1920&token=9a067055ef0555ea122caf99d9fe12d2b7d4bea25c5ac2459e1d9d69214cfdd7', 'https://news.google.com/mobile_02Feb24.png', 'https://images.kitco.com/img/height_170,width_304/icms/1a45a611-4c40-45e3-abd4-30254f6548f1.jpeg', 'https://images.kitco.com/img/height_170,width_304/icms/0e9d7fa0-12f8-49a0-a830-f42983e09a05.jpeg', 'https://news.google.com/jewelers/icons/app_store.svg', 'https://images.kitco.com/img/height_170,width_304/icms/fd0b7e1d-c5e8-468b-be03-0fb3679046d0.jpeg', 'https://news.google.com/logo_kitco.png', 'https://images.kitco.com/img/height_170,width_304/icms/39aab2f5-40a4-42ed-a35d-a79c298cb888.webp', 'https://images.kitco.com/img/height_170,width_304/icms/51b4249e-7189-46eb-bf83-10eda92f30e5.jpeg', 'https://images.kitco.com/img/height_170,width_304/icms/607d7f12-9471-42df-b28a-d9e915823a50.jpeg', 'https://news.google.com/icons/mdi_earth.svg', 'https://news.google.com/jewelers/icons/ggplay_store.svg', 'https://images.kitco.com/img/height_756,width_1340/icms/378c2c9a-82a0-4231-97ad-ec8669d06569.jpeg', 'https://news.google.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fkitco-auth%2Fuser%2FxJnATIe9lJcvvIzDYeglvOhtx563%2F1706048032610.png&w=3840&q=75', 'https://images.kitco.com/img/height_170,width_304/icms/4eb8452a-e423-4e82-99ea-7c2fcc84713e.jpeg', 'https://news.google.com/KitcoGoldLiveAppQRCode.svg', 'https://images.kitco.com/img/height_170,width_304/icms/378c2c9a-82a0-4231-97ad-ec8669d06569.jpeg', 'https://images.kitco.com/img/height_170,width_304/icms/73daee0e-c8a7-4992-a5a7-114ef64eafc0.jpeg'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtpdGNvLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUvMjAyNC0wMy0yNS9nb2xkLW1hcmtldC1kaXN0b3J0aW9ucy1jcmVhdGUtZGlmZmVyZW50LXByb2JsZW1zLXBvbGFuZC10aGFpbGFuZC1hbmTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1
Pakistan seeks long-term IMF bailout to fix broken economy – DW – 03/25/2024,['Haroon Janjua'],"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's coalition government has its work cut out as economic turmoil forces it to tackle deep-rooted structural problems.

Pakistan has long been in a state of grave economic turmoil.

Political instability, corruption, mismanagement, the COVID-19 pandemic, a global energy crisis and climate change-induced natural disasters have all taken a heavy toll on the economy.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's newly-formed government is currently seeking another bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to tackle the country's acute balance-of-payments crisis.

""We couldn't survive without yet another IMF program,"" Sharif told a meeting in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, last week that was broadcast live.

His comments came a day after the IMF agreed a provisional, or staff-level agreement, with Pakistan, which, if approved by its board, would disburse the last tranche of $1.1 billion (€1.02 billion) under an existing $3 billion standby arrangement that expires on April 11.

The US-based lender has already said it will formulate a medium-term program if Islamabad applies for it.

The Pakistan government has not officially stated the size of the additional funding it is seeking under the long-term bailout.

What's needed to revive the economy?

Many of Pakistan's over 240 million people are struggling to make ends meet, with the nation's poor particularly badly hit.

Amid soaring inflation, hovering at around 30%, many Pakistanis have seen surging costs of essential items and a sharp decline in real wages.

Foreign exchange reserves are also running low, at just $8 billion, roughly enough for eight weeks of imports.

The February general election produced a shaky coalition government, which now has the challenging task of tackling deep-rooted structural problems to pull the $350-billion economy out of its misery.

""If the government gets a long term IMF loan and comply with the terms of the deal, then the economy can revive,"" Mohammed Sohail, CEO of Topline Securities, a Karachi-based brokerage firm, told DW.

The IMF's programs, however, usually require a raft of unpopular belt-tightening measures and structural reforms.

In Pakistan's case, these could include scrapping popular subsidies on gas and electricity and broadening the tax base, as well as selling loss-making state-owned enterprises.

The government has already put up for sale Pakistan International Airline, the national flag carrier, which has long been accused of being bloated and poorly run.

""Privatization is definitely needed and long overdue in my opinion,"" Safiya Aftab, an economist and policy analyst, told DW. ""What is often missed in rhetoric on privatization and job losses, etc. is that we all, including the poor, pay for state-owned enterprises that are doing nothing and running at a loss.

""We pay because the government covers their losses through budget allocations and by incurring debt,"" she added.

""Privatization of the airline and other loss-making firms will work in favor of Pakistan as it will reduce government losses,"" agreed Sohail. ""We saw a similar situation with banks in the late 1990s and after privatization banks started giving back to the government.""

On track toward a military oligopoly?

But there's also been criticism of how authorities are pursuing the privatization drive.

""While the IMF's demand for privatization makes sense, what is happening in Pakistan may not be what the global financial institution is asking for,"" said Osama Malik, a legal expert, referring to the setting up last year of a body called the Special Investment Facilitation Council, which the government said would make investment faster and easier.

Malik alleged that the council was under the de facto control of the military, pointing to the inclusion of Pakistan's army chief in the body.

""We have recently seen prime leisure and tourism facilities owned by the federal government handed over to a newly incorporated company owned by the military. This kind of 'privatization' may create a military oligopoly in a country where the armed forces already have a huge stake in various corporate enterprises,"" he said.

Economic recovery expected to be slow

Painful reform measures could cause more distress for people in the short term, economists have warned.

""Restrictions on imports have an impact on manufacturing, in particular, while cuts in the public sector development programs mean that there is less activity in the domestic economy,"" said economist Aftab.

She predicted that economic recovery would be slow and it would take a few years for growth to return. ""The IMF program will not bring significant progress in the short run. But it will bring down the current account and fiscal deficits, which should help stabilize inflation,"" she said.

""The IMF program is not really about boosting growth, it's about achieving stabilization.""

Suicide Car Bombing Kills 5 Chinese Workers In Northwestern Pakistan,"[""Rfe Rl'S Radio Mashaal""]","DUSHANBE -- Tajik authorities detained relatives of four Tajik men accused of storming a Moscow-region concert hall and gunning down scores of people, questioning the relatives as the investigation into Russia's worst terrorist attack in decades widens.

The move comes as Russian authorities charged an eighth man in connection with the March 22 attack, which killed at least 139 people and wounded scores more.

The Islamic State militant group has claimed responsibility for the attack on the Crocus City Hall, where people were taking their seats for a concert by a Soviet-era rock band when four men began gunning people down, and then set fire to the venue.

As of March 26, the death toll stood at 139, with more than 120 people wounded, many hospitalized with gunshot wounds or burns.

Four ethnic Tajik men who worked as migrant laborers in Russia have been accused of staging the attack. The four appeared in a Moscow court on March 24, and were ordered held in pretrial detention. All four showed signs of being severely beaten, and unconfirmed reports said they may have been tortured while in custody.

In the Tajik capital, Dushanbe, and several surrounding towns, law enforcement authorities went to the homes of relatives of the men, and took them back to the capital for questioning, neighbors and relatives told RFE/RL.

In Vahdat, a town just east of Dushanbe, the mother, brother, two uncles, and other relatives of one of the accused gunmen -- Saidakram Rajabalizoda -- were taken away by police on the evening of March 25, a domestic employee told RFE/RL. Other neighbors said that the head of the neighborhood where the family lived was also taken by police.

An unknown number of relatives of another of the suspected gunmen -- Muhammadsobir Faizov -- were taken from their homes in Dushanbe, neighbors told RFE/RL.

Tajik authorities have made no statement about the detentions. The Foreign Ministry issued a statement hours after the attack, refuting reports identifying three other Tajik men who allegedly participated in the attack, but has made no further comment.

In Moscow, Russians flocked to the venue to lay flowers and mourn the dead, while rescue workers picked through the wreckage of the concert hall, which was gutted by a fire shortly after the shooting.

Russian authorities charged an eighth man in connection with the attack, according to the state news agency TASS. Moscow's Basmanny District Court ordered the detention of Alisher Kasimov, a Kyrgyz-born Russian citizen, accusing him of allegedly renting an apartment to the four attackers.

Kasimov's detention brings the number of people ordered held in custody to eight as of March 26; 11 people in all have been detained by police, according to officials.

A day earlier, a Moscow court ordered three men held on charges related to their providing a car and an apartment to the attackers.

President Vladimir Putin has stated that the attack was carried about by ""radical Islamists,"" but he and other top officials have also asserted that Ukraine and the United States had a role to play -- something both countries have dismissed outright.



Nikolai Patrushev, the hawkish director of Russia's Security Council, repeated that allegation on March 26 when asked by reporters in passing whether Kyiv or the Islamic State group was behind the attack.



""Of course, Ukraine,"" he said.

The director of Russia's main domestic intelligence agency, meanwhile, also asserted Ukraine was involved, repeating earlier statements that the suspects had sought to travel to Ukraine after the attack.



""In general, we believe they are involved in this,"" Federal Security Service director Aleksandr Bortnikov was quoted by Russian reporters as saying.



""We believe the action was prepared both by the radical Islamists themselves and, of course, facilitated by Western special services, and Ukraine's special services themselves have a direct connection to this,"" he was cited as saying by Russian news agencies.



He provided no evidence.



In Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy again vehemently denied any involvement on March 25, saying in his nightly video address that Putin was always seeking to blame ""someone else.""

U.S. officials have also dismissed the assertions, saying publicly that intelligence showed Islamic State was behind the attack. And French President Emmanuel Macron also said a branch of Islamic State ""planned the attack and carried it out,"" adding the same group had plotted attacks in France.

The images of the four Tajik men, shown badly beaten, drew criticism and questions about the Russian authorities' methods.

Video that circulated on Telegram purported to show one of the men having his ear cut off and stuffed into his mouth. Another Telegram channel known to be linked to the Wagner mercenary group published a photograph purporting to show one of the detained men with his genitals attached to an electric wire.

Team Against Torture, a Russian organization that advocates against police brutality, said in a statement that the culprits must face stern punishment, but ""savagery should not be the answer to savagery.""

About two weeks before the attack, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow released an unusual warning, saying radical ""extremists"" might be plotting to target public locations, and urged American citizens to be careful.



The warning was met with derision by officials, including Putin, who suggested it was aimed at embarrassing him ahead of presidential elections that he easily won in the absence of any credible opponents.



Speaking in Washington on March 25, White House national-security adviser John Kirby said U.S. officials shared the intelligence warnings ahead of time, under a tenet of the U.S. intelligence community called the ""duty to warn.""



The ""duty to warn"" is a years-old executive order that obliges U.S. intelligence officials to lean toward sharing knowledge of a threat if conditions allow -- even if the apparent targets are adversaries.

Pakistan’s Generals Fail to Fix the Election,[],"Ian Bremmer is a foreign affairs columnist and editor-at-large at TIME. He is the president of Eurasia Group, a political-risk consultancy, and GZERO Media, a company dedicated to providing intelligent and engaging coverage of international affairs. He teaches applied geopolitics at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, and his most recent book is The Power of Crisis

Pakistan’s worst-kept secret is that its military dominates its government. Whether to safeguard the nation against chaos or to protect their own privileged access to power and wealth, its generals have manipulated the country’s politics for decades. Pakistan’s voters, like voters elsewhere, want change. February’s ugly election fiasco shows that it’s only getting harder for the army to prevent political disrupters from upending their plans but, unfortunately for Pakistan’s future, they have yet again managed to override public demand for a new direction.

A brief recap: The generals and popular leader Imran Khan decided some time ago they could no longer trust one another. The army then removed Khan from his post as Prime Minister and put him in jail, as it has done to many past Prime Ministers who refused to respect their dominance. He now faces more than 150 criminal charges, all of which he denies.

When the brass refused to let him contest February’s national elections, even from prison, aides in Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party created AI-generated Khan speeches that were then broadcast around Pakistan. In a nation where 40% of voters are illiterate, army-dominated courts ruled that ballots could not include the symbol of Khan’s party, a cricket bat to reference Khan’s professional sporting prowess, but the party vowed to press ahead. When the generals refused to allow PTI members to appear on ballots, many ran as independents.

Both the army and a former Prime Minister, the exiled-then-rehabilitated Nawaz Sharif, were confident that destroying Khan’s candidacy would assure a victory for Sharif. It did not. Even after manipulating courts and the media, stuffing ballot boxes, and turning off mobile phone service and social media in areas where Khan voters were setting their get-out-the-vote plans, the nation’s self-appointed overlords could not stop voters from shocking Pakistan and the world by handing victory to the independents who stood for Imran Khan’s PTI. They didn’t win a majority, but they did win more seats than any single party.

It took the army and its political subordinates three weeks to untangle this mess and find a way to keep Khan’s party out of power. On March 4, Pakistan’s newly formed Parliament announced that Shehbaz Sharif—Nawaz’s brother and the interim Prime Minister since the army grabbed power again last August—will again lead a coalition government. All in the name of “stability.”

It’s reasonable to wonder why Sharif, or anyone else, would want the job. Pakistan ranks 161st out of 191 countries in the U.N.’s Human Development Index. Its economic prospects remain poor. About 40% of Pakistan’s people live in poverty, and inflation stands at about 30%. Power outages are a fact of daily life. To pay its foreign debt to avoid default, Pakistan’s government must come up with more than $20 billion. Its current reserves have dwindled to less than $10 billion.

The country is increasingly isolated. China and Saudi Arabia, traditional investors in Pakistan, increasingly see the country as a bad commercial bet. Traditional security partners in the U.S. are less interested, particularly since the U.S. withdrawal from neighboring Afghanistan. And though Khan has vowed that PTI lawmakers will sit in opposition, the party’s followers have already demonstrated an ability and willingness to generate major trouble in the streets of Pakistan’s largest cities.

Worse still, the army establishment has shown Pakistan’s voters that their country’s democracy cannot create the change they need. That bodes ill for the nation and all who would lead it, whether they’re elected or not.","{'https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-2039298429.jpg?quality=85', 'https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-2039298429.jpg?quality=85&w=2400'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiIWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vNjg5ODQ5MS82ODk4NDkxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1

A court in Pakistan awarded the death penalty to a 22-year-old student and a life term to a teenager accused of blasphemy, according to reports.

An additional district and sessions judge on Friday announced the sentences in the case of the student and a 17-year-old boy in Gujranwala over videos and photos sent over the phone, the Dawn newspaper reported.

The two suspects had been booked by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on the charges of sharing blasphemous material through WhatsApp, and a case was lodged in Lahore, it said.

However, the case was referred by the Lahore High Court to a local court in Gujranwala for trial.

The plaintiff alleged he had received the videos and photos from three different mobile phone numbers. The FIA said that it had examined the plaintiff’s phone and established that “obscene material” had been sent, Dawn said.

Defence lawyers argued that the two students had been “trapped in a false case”, according to the paper.

The blasphemy law seeks the death penalty for anyone who insults Islam and its prophet Mohammad. It says that any “derogatory remarks, etc., in respect of the Holy Prophet either spoken or written, or by visible representation, or by any imputation, innuendo or insinuation, directly or indirectly shall be punished with death, or imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine”.

The law is rooted in 19th century colonial legislation to protect places of worship and was strengthened as part of a drive to Islamise the state during the military dictatorship of General Mohammad Zia ul-Haq in the 1980s. Although no one has ever been executed, blasphemy convictions are common in Pakistan.

Most convictions are thrown out on appeal by higher courts, but mobs have lynched dozens of people in vigilante attacks even before a case is put on trial.","{'https://news.google.com/img/icons/google.svg', 'https://news.google.com/img/logo-white-out.svg', 'https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/02/13/07/Pakistan_Blasphemy_45406.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp', 'https://static.independent.co.uk/static-assets/images/newsletter/breaking-news/breaking-news-thumb.png'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL2FzaWEvc291dGgtYXNpYS9wYWtpc3Rhbi1ibGFzcGhlbXktY291cnQtZGVhdGgtcGVuYWx0eS1zdHVkZW50LWIyNTA5ODM3Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1
Pakistan Air strike: Why did Pakistan carry out airstrikes in Afghanistan? | Explained,['Authors'],"March 22, 2024 10:28 am | Updated March 23, 2024 10:33 am IST

The story so far: In a major escalation of tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, Pakistani fighters carried out airstrikes inside the Afghan provinces of Paktika and Khost, leading to fighting along the border. At least eight civilians, including three children, were killed in the pre-dawn attacks, Afghan officials said.

The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other splinter groups were the prime target of the “intelligence-based anti-terrorist operations” early on March 18, the Pakistan Foreign Ministry said, blaming TTP for the surge in terror incidents in the country. Most recently, seven Pakistani soldiers were killed in a suicide bombing at an army outpost in North Waziristan district, for which President Asif Ali Zardari had vowed retaliation.

The Taliban strongly condemned the strikes, and as retaliation, attacked Pakistani military posts along the border using “heavy weapons.” In a statement, the Taliban described the military action as a “reckless” violation of Afghanistan’s territorial integrity, adding that such incidents could have “very bad consequences.”

Although the fighting along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border has stopped for now, the incident highlights the increasing tension between the two countries, as Islamabad has accused the Taliban of providing refuge to terrorists launching frequent attacks on its territory.

The backstory

The 2,670-kilometre Durand Line which marks the international land border between Pakistan and Afghanistan has long been a point of contention between the two nations. Cutting through the Pashtun-dominated regions, the Line stretches from Afghanistan’s border with China in the north to its border with Iran in the south.

A majority of Pashtuns living along the border, including Taliban leaders and fighters, have refused to endorse the demarcation. Successive Afghan governments have also disputed the Line, claiming Pashtun territories in Pakistan, including the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and parts of the North West Frontier Province. The disagreement over the border has caused tensions between Pakistan and the Taliban— despite historically good bilateral ties. Notably, Pakistan played a significant role in mediating the 2020 U.S.-Taliban agreement and supported the Taliban after they regained power in Afghanistan in 2021.

Why has Pakistan’s relationship with the Taliban soured?

Tensions became apparent following the Taliban’s return to power in 2021, after it firmly rejected the Durand Line as a permanent border, asserting that it divided ethnic Pashtuns. A series of skirmishes between the two forces along the border were reported in the following days.

The tensions further escalated after the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistani Taliban, called off a ceasefire in November 2022, when talks brokered by the Afghan Taliban broke down. The Afghan Taliban and the TTP are separate groups with common ideological links. The Pakistani Taliban is behind some of the bloodiest attacks in the country, responsible for killing thousands of Pakistanis in 15 years of insurgency.

A regrouped TTP ordered nationwide attacks after the ceasefire ended, which resulted in an unprecedented surge in terror incidents across Pakistan. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, which border Afghanistan, have been the worst-affected provinces. The country saw a 69% increase in attacks in 2023, an 81% rise in resultant deaths, and a 60% surge in the number of injuries, according to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS). The total violence-related fatalities reached a record six-year high last year, with over 1,500 deaths from 789 terror attacks and counter-terror operations, as per reports by the Islamabad-based Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS).

Amid a multifaceted crisis, Pakistan urged the Afghan Taliban to control the TTP. While the Taliban assured that they wouldn’t permit anyone to use Afghan soil for attacks against any country, the surge in attacks since 2021 has created distrust between Pakistan and the Taliban.

What triggered the airstrikes?

On March 16, seven Pakistani soldiers were killed after a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden truck into a post in North Waziristan. The next day, while offering funeral prayers for the soldiers, President Asif Ali Zardari vowed to “respond strongly.” Hours later, the Taliban released a statement, alleging that Pakistani planes had bombed the Barmal district of Paktika province and Sepera district in Khost at 3 a.m. on March 18, resulting in the deaths of civilians.

Pakistan confirmed that the airstrikes hit rebels belonging to TTP’s Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group after the outfit claimed responsibility for the March 16 attack. In a press release, the Pakistani Foreign Office said that the country had conveyed its serious concerns to the Afghan government over the presence of terror outfits including TTP inside Afghanistan over the past two years. “These terrorists pose a grave threat to Pakistan’s security and have consistently used Afghan territory to launch terror attacks inside Pakistani territory,” it added.

Operation Against Terrorist Sanctuaries of TTP

“We have repeatedly urged the Afghan authorities to take concrete and effective action to ensure that the Afghan soil is not used as a staging ground for terrorism against Pakistan… Pakistan has great respect for the people of Afghanistan. However, certain elements among those in power in Afghanistan are actively patronising TTP and using them as a proxy against Pakistan,” the statement read. Describing the TTP as a “collective threat to regional peace and security,” Pakistan added that it will continue to work towards finding joint solutions to counter terrorism and to prevent any terrorist organisation from sabotaging bilateral relations with Afghanistan.

Notably, this was not the first time that Pakistan has launched airstrikes against Afghanistan. In April 2022, the Pakistani military carried out a similar operation in Khost and Kunar provinces.

Syed Muhammad Ali, an Islamabad-based security expert, told the Associated Press that the said strikes indicate that Pakistan’s patience for the Taliban’s “continued hospitality” for terrorists conducting frequent attacks on Pakistan from Afghan territory has finally run out.

What has the Taliban said?

The Taliban has warned Pakistan of “very bad consequences which will be out of Pakistan’s control” in case of continued attacks inside its territory. The Taliban spokesperson claimed that attacks took place on houses of civilians, killing five women and three children. He said in a statement that Pakistan “should not blame Afghanistan for the lack of control, incompetence and problems in its own territory”.

The Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs also issued a protest letter to the summoned charge d’affaires of Pakistan’s embassy, saying the country “won’t tolerate any kind of invasion of its territory.”

The Taliban denied Pakistan’s Special Representative to Afghanistan Ambassador Asif Durrani’s recent charge that Afghanistan was providing shelter to 5,000 to 6,000 TTP militants, but acknowledged the possibility of their presence due to Afghanistan’s rugged terrain. “We reject the presence of any foreign groups in Afghanistan… But one thing we must accept is that Afghanistan shares a very long border area with Pakistan, and there are places with rugged terrain including mountains and forests, and places that might be out of our control,” Mr. Mujahid told Tolo News.","{'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/more-search.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/search-gray-icon.svg', 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=123456&cs_ucfr=1&cv=2.0&cj=1', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/thehindu-logo.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/account-btn-icon-black.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/google-signin/group-12945.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/myaccount-gift-black-icon.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/share-page-icon.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/h-circle-black-white-new.svg', 'https://th-i.thgim.com/public/news/international/4bq43g/article38143986.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/FILE-PHOTO-A-soldier-stands-guard-along-the-border-fence-outside-the-Kitton-out', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/menu-hamber-icon.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/close-image-icon.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/open-app-arrow.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/google-signin/th-online-icon.svg'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdS5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL3Bha2lzdGFuLWFpcnN0cmlrZXMtYWZnaGFuaXN0YW4tdGFsaWJhbi1pc2xhbWFiYWQtdGVycm9yaXNtLWV4cGxhaW5lci9hcnRpY2xlNjc5NzkxMDUuZWNl0gGKAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9uZXdzL2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvcGFraXN0YW4tYWlyc3RyaWtlcy1hZmdoYW5pc3Rhbi10YWxpYmFuLWlzbGFtYWJhZC10ZXJyb3Jpc20tZXhwbGFpbmVyL2FydGljbGU2Nzk3OTEwNS5lY2UvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1

File photo of attack in Dasu that resulted in the deaths of nine Chinese nationals,(AFP)

The suicide bomber rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a convoy of Chinese engineers travelling from Islamabad to their camp in Dasu, located in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Reuters quoted regional police chief Mohammad Ali Gandapur as saying.

""Five Chinese nationals and their Pakistani driver were killed in the attack,"" Gandapur said.

No one claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack.

Bisham Station House Officer (SHO) Bakht Zahir said that the incident was a “suicide blast” and the authorities concerned were collecting the evidence, Dawn.com reported.

Security arrangements were tightened at the spot and the bodies were being shifted to a hospital, he further said.

""We will investigate from where and how the vehicle of a suicide bomber came and how it happened,” the SHO said.

This is the third major attack on Chinese interests in Pakistan within a week.

The first two attacks hit an airbase and a strategic port in the southwest province of Balochistan where China is investing billions in infrastructure projects.

Chinese engineers and Pakistani construction workers have for several years been working on hydroelectric projects as part of Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative in the western province of Khyber-Paktunkhwa.

Dasu, home to a significant dam project, has been a target of previous attacks.

In 2021, the attack in Dasu resulted in the deaths of nine Chinese nationals, along with two Pakistani children. The incident took place when a bus carrying Chinese engineers and workers to the Dasu Hydropower Project site was targeted.

Initially, there was confusion surrounding the nature of the attack, with some reports suggesting it was a bus accident. However, subsequent investigations revealed it was indeed a terrorist attack. The bus was hit by a blast, causing it to plunge into a ravine.

Pakistani police say 5 Chinese nationals and their local driver were killed in a suicide attack,['Riaz Khan'],"Police officers examine the site of suicide bombing at a highway in Shangla, a district in the Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Tuesday, March 26, 2024.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — A suicide bomber in northwest Pakistan rammed his explosive-laden car into a vehicle Tuesday, killing five Chinese nationals and their Pakistani driver, police and government officials said.

The attack happened in Shangla, a district in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, local police chief Bakhat Zahir said. He added that the five killed were construction workers and engineers heading to the Dasu Dam, the biggest hydropower project in Pakistan, where they worked.

Authorities said the bodies were transported to a nearby hospital, and that security forces started a search in the area to look for accomplices. Police also launched an investigation into the attack.

No group claimed responsibility, but suspicion is likely to fall on Baluch separatists, who have claimed previous such attacks.

Tuesday’s attack came less than a week after Pakistani security forces killed eight Baluchistan Liberation Army militants who opened fire on a convoy carrying Chinese citizens outside the Chinese-funded Gwadar port in the volatile southwestern Baluchistan province.

The BLA wants independence from the central government in Islamabad.

Pakistan's top political and military leadership denounced the attack.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the Chinese Embassy where he met with the Chinese ambassador, Jiang Zaidong, a government statement said. It said that Sharif condemned the attack, saying those who orchestrated the attack would be punished and a high-level investigation will be conducted into the attack.

“The sympathies of the entire nation, including me, are with the families of the Chinese citizens"" who were killed in the attack, he said.

In a statement, the Chinese Embassy condemned the attack and said it has requested Pakistan to “thoroughly investigate the attack and severely punish the perpetrators.”

Earlier, Pakistan's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also condemned the attack in a statement on Tuesday and offered condolences to the families of the deceased. He wrote: “The enemy has targeted Chinese citizens who are the friends of Pakistan,” without elaborating who he was referring to. He also vowed to ”deal with an iron hand"" those responsible, and expressed hope the attack wouldn't negatively impact Pakistani-Chinese relations.

Naqvi also visited the Chinese Embassy in the capital, Islamabad, where he briefed the Chinese ambassador about the attack, promising a full investigation, according to the Ministry of Interior.

Also Tuesday, Pakistan's military denounced the attack.

“Such heinous acts of violence against innocent civilians, foreigners and the armed forces will not deter the resolve of the Pakistani people, its security forces and our partners to root out the menace (of) terrorism from our country,” it said in a statement.

Thousands of Chinese nationals work in Shangla on projects relating to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which includes a multitude of megaprojects such as road construction, power plants and agriculture.

The CPEC, also known as the One Road Project, is a lifeline for Pakistan’s cash-strapped government, currently facing one of its worst economic crises. The project is part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a global endeavor aimed at reconstituting the Silk Road and linking China to all corners of Asia.

Chinese laborers working on CPEC-related projects in Pakistan have come under attack in recent years.

In July 2021, at least 13 people, including nine Chinese nationals, were killed when a suicide bomber detonated his vehicle near a bus carrying several Chinese and Pakistani engineers and laborers, prompting the Chinese companies to suspend work at the time.

Since then, Pakistan has beefed up security on CPEC-related projects.

A suicide bomber rammed a vehicle into a convoy of Chinese engineers working on a dam project in northwest Pakistan on Tuesday, killing six people, police said, the third major attack on Chinese interests in the South Asian country in a week.

“The Chinese embassy and consulates in Pakistan have immediately launched emergency work, demanding that the Pakistani side conduct a thorough investigation into the attack, severely punish the perpetrators, and take practical and effective measures to protect the safety of Chinese citizens,” the embassy said in statement.

The first two attacks hit an airbase and a strategic port in the southwest province of Balochistan where China is investing billions in infrastructure projects.

The engineers were on their way from Islamabad to their camp at the dam construction site in Dasu in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Mohammad Ali Gandapur, the regional police chief, told Reuters.

“Five Chinese nationals and their Pakistani driver were killed in the attack,” Gandapur said.

Dasu is the site of a major dam and the area has been attacked in the past. A blast on a bus killed 13 people, including nine Chinese nationals, in 2021.

Chinese engineers have been working on a number of projects Pakistan with Beijing investing over $65 billion in infrastructure projects as part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) under its wider Belt and Road initiative.

No one claimed responsibility for Tuesday’s attack, nor was there a claim for the 2021 attack. Pakistan is home to twin insurgencies – one by Islamists and the other ethnic militants seeking secession.

While Chinese interests are primarily targeted by the ethnic militants seeking to push Beijing out of mineral-rich Balochistan, they generally operate in the country’s south and southwest – far from the site of Tuesday’s attack.

Islamists mostly operate in the country’s northwest in the area the convoy was attacked.

The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police had reached the spot and started relief operations.

A separate police source told Reuters the convoy was carrying staff of the construction firm China Gezhouba Group Company (CGGC) working on the Dasu hydropower project – the same company targeted in 2021.

Construction work ceased for months after that attack.

China’s embassy in Islamabad did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

The attacks come a week before Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to fly to Beijing, according to a source in the Prime Minister’s Office. It will be Sharif’s first visit since taking office following February elections.

Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar condemned the attack, and said the country would continue to fight back against militants.

Pakistani security forces kill 4 militants in operations in northwest bordering Afghanistan,[],"DERA ISLAMIL KHAN, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistan security forces killed four insurgents in an overnight raid on a militant hideout in the country’s northwest bordering Afghanistan, the military said Tuesday.

Troops found a cache of weapons, ammunition, and explosives in the intelligence-based operation conducted at the hideout in Dera Ismail Khan, a district in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, the military said in a statement.

Though security forces often conduct such raids, the latest one came hours after insurgents from an outlawed Baluchistan Liberation Army or BLA tried to sneak into a navy air base in Baluchistan province.

A soldier and four attackers were killed in the ensuing shootout in Turbat district, the military said on Tuesday. No damage was caused to the Siddiqui air station.

BLA claimed responsibility for the attack. The group was designated a terrorist group by Pakistan, the United Kingdom and the United States years ago.","{'https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/94c503b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/640x236+0+0/resize/320x118!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fc3%2F4c%2F65482a7b452db66043542c093eaf%2Fpromo-2x.png', 'https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/0254d6a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4500x2995+0+2/resize/320x213!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F8e%2F27%2F74926b1aa0476958119aae730292%2F58fc761ce1da4a9a8104c95a1f3a1945', 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005041&cv=4.4.0&cj=1', 'https://assets.apnews.com/fa/ba/9258a7114f5ba5c7202aaa1bdd66/aplogo.svg', 'https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/83c7074/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4500x2531+0+234/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F8e%2F27%2F74926b1aa0476958119aae730292%2F58fc761ce1da4a9a8104c95a1f3a1945', 'https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/8650001/2147483647/strip/true/crop/992x617+0+0/resize/225x140!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Ffc%2F24%2F7ff11448446fb8500bc984551325%2Faplogo-with-tagline.png'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3Bha2lzdGFuLXNlY3VyaXR5LWZvcmNlcy1taWxpdGFudC1oaWRlb3V0LXJhaWQtNDUwZGI3NGVmYTVjMDIyMGM0OTgyNWJkZDRhODAyYzDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1
"1 Soldier, 4 Terrorists Killed In Attack At Pakistan's One Of Biggest Naval Air Bases",[],"An official said that no loss of sensitive naval installations was reported (File)

Armed Baloch terrorists tried to infiltrate one of the main naval air bases in Pakistan's restive Balochistan province, but security forces foiled the attack and killed all four terrorists.

The attack on Monday night took place in Turbat, a turbulent district in the sparsely populated province.

Makran Commissioner Saeed Ahmed Umrani told the media that security forces had foiled an armed terrorist attack at the PNS Siddique Naval Air Base which is among the biggest naval air stations in the country.

""The armed men attacked from three sides of the airport boundary, but security forces responded immediately and foiled their attempt to infiltrate the premises,"" he said.

Eyewitnesses reported they had heard gunfire and explosions throughout the night.

According to a statement by the army, terrorists on the night of March 25/26 attempted to attack Pakistan Naval Base, PNS Siddique in the Turbat area of Balochistan province. However, it was thwarted due to the swift and effective response by the troops ensuring the safety and security of personnel and assets.

""Security forces in the vicinity were immediately mobilized to support the naval troops. Synergetic and effective response by the armed forces enabled the killing of all four terrorists in ensuing joint clearance operation,"" the army said.

However, during an intense fire exchange, a 24-year-old Sepoy of the paramilitary Frontier Corps Balochistan was killed.

A security official said on condition of anonymity that terrorists were unable to cause any damage at the airbase or to aeroplanes.

No loss of sensitive naval installations was reported, the official said.

A sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area and Pakistan Armed Forces were committed to eliminating the menace of terrorism from the country at all costs.

The banned Balochistan Liberation Army claimed that its Majeed Brigade was behind the attack.

This is the third major attack on security forces and installations this year in Balochistan claimed by the BLA with the first two attacks being also being repulsed by security forces.

Earlier in the year, security forces were attacked in Mach town in which at least ten people were killed but attempts to breach the Mach jail were thwarted by security forces.

On March 24, the BLA also claimed responsibility for an attack on the Gwadar Port Authority Complex. Security forces had killed eight militants of the banned separatist group in the gunfire.

Balochistan, bordering Iran and Afghanistan, is home to a long-running violent insurgency. Baloch insurgent groups have previously carried out several attacks targeting the USD 60 billion CPEC projects.

The BLA accuses China and Islamabad of exploitation of the resource-rich province, a charge rejected by the authorities.

BLA's Majeed Brigade, which was formed in 2011, is a particularly lethal guerilla cell of the BLA.

It has been alleged that the group also maintains sanctuaries in areas along the Pakistan-Iran border.

The brigade, which is the suicide squad of the BLA, mostly targets security forces and Chinese interests in Pakistan. It had also claimed responsibility for the April 2022 suicide attack outside the Karachi University's Confucius Institute.

Pakistan Repulses Insurgent Attack on Southwestern Naval Air Base,['Ayaz Gul'],"Pakistan officials said Monday that security forces killed at least four insurgents trying to infiltrate a naval air base in southwestern Baluchistan province.

A security official told VOA that the late-night insurgent attack in Turbat, a turbulent district in the sparsely populated province, was quickly intercepted and thwarted.

""The situation is under control. All the attackers have been neutralized,"" the Pakistani official told VOA, requesting anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters. He said the clashes did not inflict any casualties on security forces.

The Baluch Liberation Army (BLA), an outlawed insurgent group, took responsibility for staging the assault. In a statement sent to reporters, the group said members of its so-called suicide unit, known as the Majeed Brigade, had carried out the raid and inflicted heavy casualties on Pakistani forces.

Designated as a global terrorist organization by Pakistan, the United Kingdom and the United States, BLA often releases inflated details about its violent campaigns.

The Pakistani province, rich in natural resources, has experienced a decadeslong insurgency spearheaded by BLA and other outlawed insurgent groups.

Last week, eight heavily armed BLA militants stormed a government compound in nearby Gwadar district, home to a China-operated port. The ensuing gunfight killed all the assailants and left several Pakistani security personnel dead.

The deep-water Gwadar port is located near the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial oil shipping route in the Arabian Sea. A Chinese state company built the port and runs it under a long-term agreement with the Pakistani government.

The port is central to the multibillion-dollar bilateral collaboration known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC, an extension of Beijing's global infrastructure program, known as the Belt and Road Initiative.

Separatist Baluch insurgents have also attacked Chinese experts working on CPEC and other projects, killing several of them in recent years and prompting China to repeatedly call on Pakistan to enhance the security of its citizens.","{'https://gdb.voanews.com/A9502BF0-4571-446A-937D-5980A5D56BE2_w250_r1_s.png', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-9f0d-08dc4aa15c72_w100_r1.png', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-94f3-08dc4b52df17_cx0_cy3_cw0_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-1129-08dc4dbc1c20_w160_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0a00-0242-f554-08dc37b37b59_cx0_cy1_cw0_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/Content/responsive/VOA/en-US/img/logo.svg', 'https://news.google.com/Content/responsive/VOA/en-US/img/logo-compact.svg', 'https://news.google.com/Content/responsive/VOA/en-US/img/logo-print_color.png', 'https://news.google.com/Content/responsive/img/player-spinner.png', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-f333-08dc4d199c6a_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-a614-08dc4d99b9c9_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/B15DAF8A-72DD-4C8F-B599-15AE1E38324C.jpg', 'https://bbg.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/b/ss/bbgrvoaenglish-bbgprod-bbgentityvoa-bbgunitvoaenglish/1/G.4--NS/1191845856?pageName=voa%3aeng%3ar%3aarticle%3apakistan%20repulses%20insurgent%20attack%20on%20southwestern%20naval%20air%20base&c6=pakistan%20repulses%20insurgent%20attack%20on%20southwestern%20naval%20air%20base&pangea_version=8.30.0.0.275&v6=D=c6&g=https%3a%2f%2fwww.voanews.com&c1=D=g&v1=D=g&events=event1&c7=pakistan%20repulses%20insurgent%20attack%20on%20southwestern%20naval%20air%20base&v7=D=c7&c16=voa%20english&v16=D=c16&c5=s_south-central-asia&v5=D=c5&ch=english&v15=D=ch&c15=D=ch&c4=article&v4=D=c4&c14=7542228&v14=D=c14&c20=no&c17=responsive&v17=D=c17', 'https://news.google.com/Content/responsive/VOA/en-US/img/logo-print.gif'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvcGFraXN0YW4tcmVwdWxzZXMtaW5zdXJnZW50LWF0dGFjay1vbi1zb3V0aHdlc3Rlcm4tbmF2YWwtYWlyLWJhc2UvNzU0MjIyOC5odG1s0gFqaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm9hbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3Bha2lzdGFuLXJlcHVsc2VzLWluc3VyZ2VudC1hdHRhY2stb24tc291dGh3ZXN0ZXJuLW5hdmFsLWFpci1iYXNlLzc1NDIyMjguaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1
Shaheen Afridi's Pakistan Captaincy In Trouble? PCB Provides Massive Update,[],"Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi has indicated that a decision on Shaheen Shah Afridi's future as captain of the T20 team will be taken after the upcoming national camp in Kakul. According to sources in PCB sources, wicketkeeper Mohammed Rizwan is being tipped to take over as captain in both white-ball formats. ""The selection committee and board is working on two or three things and the selectors will take decision on the captaincy after the training camp in Kakul,"" Naqvi told reporters. ""The selection committee has to do some brainstorming and sit together and decide on the captain,"" Naqvi said, adding that his committee is in favour of continuity.

Shaheen replaced Babar Azam as T20I captain after Pakistan's dismal show in the ODI World Cup in India. The decision was taken by the erstwhile committee headed by Zaka Ashraf, who also picked Shan Masood as Test captain.

It was Shaheen's success as captain of the Lahore Qalandars, having led the franchise to back-to-back PSL titles that got him national captaincy.

However a 1-4 drubbing in a five-match T20I series in New Zealand and finishing last in this edition of PSL has certainly weakened his case ahead of T20 World Cup scheduled in June.","{'https://sdata.ndtv.com/sportz/Sportz/cricket/flags/3.png?output-quality=80&downsize=18:*',

Pakistan cricketer Amir named among T20 probables after retirement U-turn,[],"The fast bowler has come out of retirement and made himself available for the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup.

Fast bowler Mohammad Amir has been included in Pakistan’s group of 29 cricketers who will undergo training at the country’s military base ahead of the 2024 ICC Twenty20 World Cup in June.

Amir’s inclusion comes a day after he came out of retirement and after the country’s cricket board announced changes to its selection process which made him feel “needed”.

The left-arm bowler announced his international retirement at the age of 28 in December 2020, saying he could no longer play under the then-management and that he was being “tortured mentally”.

“I still dream to play for Pakistan! Life brings us to the points where at times we have to reconsider our decisions,” he wrote on Sunday on social media platform X.

After “positive” talks with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) officials, he said the PCB made him feel “that I was needed and can still play for Pakistan”.

“I declare I am available to be considered for upcoming T20WC,” the 31-year-old added.

Amir’s precocious, stop-start career was halted in 2010 after he, along with then-Pakistan Test captain Salman Butt and fellow pacer Mohammad Asif, were banned for five years over a spot fixing scandal. All three were also jailed by a British court.

Amir returned to play for Pakistan in 2016. He has represented Pakistan in 36 Tests, 61 ODIs and 50 T20Is.

His international wicket haul stands at 259, with 59 coming in the game’s shortest format. As a teenager, he was part of Pakistan’s T20 World Cup winning squad in 2009. Eight years later, he played a key role in Pakistan’s triumphant run at the 2017 Champions Trophy in England.

Amir’s announcement came a day after all-rounder Imad Wasim reversed his own decision to retire four months ago and made himself available to play in this year’s World Cup. Wasim was also named in the squad announced on Monday.

I still dream to play for Pakistan! life brings us to the points where at times we have to reconsider our decisions, There has been few positive discussions between myself and the PCB where they respectfully made me feel that I was needed and can still play for Pakistan after… — Mohammad Amir (@iamamirofficial) March 24, 2024

Changes in selection panel

Earlier on Sunday, newly elected PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi announced a seven-member selection panel, making the captain and head coach part of the process.

“We have reorganised the selection committee with seven members but the different thing is that there will be no chairman,” Naqvi told a press conference, adding that each member would have “equal powers”.

Former captain Mohammad Yousuf, Wahab Riaz, Abdul Razzaq and Asad Shafiq – all of whom played for Pakistan – will be joined by the current captain, the head coach and a data analyst.

Pakistan are without a head coach following their disastrous World Cup (50 overs) in India last year where they failed to qualify for the semifinals.

Afterwards Babar Azam stepped down from captaincy of all formats and was replaced by Shan Masood as Test captain and Shaheen Shah Afridi as T20I captain.

The then-head coach Mickey Arthur was replaced by team director Mohammad Hafeez under whom Pakistan suffered a 3-0 Test whitewash in Australia and a 4-1 series defeat in a T20I series in New Zealand.

Naqvi on Sunday left open whether Shaheen will be retained as captain, saying the selection committee will make a final decision on its T20I captain after the training camp.

The chairman also announced the restoration of a central contract for fast bowler Haris Rauf, who was suspended last month after he refused to play Tests in Australia.

“Rauf has stated that there was some misunderstanding so we have restored his central contract,” said Naqvi.

Pakistan will play five T20Is against New Zealand at home followed by two in Ireland and four in England before featuring in the T20 World Cup, where they will kick off their campaign against co-hosts United States on June 6. They will then face neighbours India in New York on June 9, before their final group match against Canada on June 11.

The players named for the training camp are: Aamir Jamal, Abrar Ahmed, Azam Khan, Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Haseebullah, Iftikhar Ahmed, Imad Wasim, Irfan Khan, Mehran Mumtaz, Mohammad Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Ali, Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Haris, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Rizwan, Mohammad Wasim Jnr, Naseem Shah, Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha, Saud Shakeel, Shadab Khan, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Usama Mir, Usman Khan and Zaman Khan.","{'https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AP17169521496681-1711343317.jpg?resize=1920%2C1333', 'https://news.google.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AP17169521496681-1711343317.jpg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80', 'https://news.google.com/static/media/aj-footer-logo.bac952ad.svg'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vc3BvcnRzLzIwMjQvMy8yNS9wYWtpc3Rhbi1jcmlja2V0ZXItYW1pci1uYW1lZC1hbW9nc3QtdDIwLXByb2JhYmxlcy1hZnRlci1yZXRpcmVtZW50LXUtdHVybtIBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vYW1wL3Nwb3J0cy8yMDI0LzMvMjUvcGFraXN0YW4tY3JpY2tldGVyLWFtaXItbmFtZWQtYW1vZ3N0LXQyMC1wcm9iYWJsZXMtYWZ0ZXItcmV0aXJlbWVudC11LXR1cm4?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1
"Pakistan Needs Another IMF Loan For Stability, Says PM Shehbaz Sharif",[],"Shehbaz Sharif said along with the IMF program, the government will focus on fostering growth.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday that Pakistan needs another loan programme from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to stabilise its fragile economy, ARY News reported.

PM Sharif said this while addressing a ceremony to encourage taxpayers in the country in Islamabad.

The prime minister said the government is compelled to enter into a new IMF deal for the purpose of stability, ARY News reported.

However, he said that along with the IMF program, the government will focus on fostering growth, creating job opportunities, and addressing the issue of inflation.

Shehbaz Sharif said the federal government in collaboration with the provincial governments will create enabling circumstances for the private sector and address their problems. He said that refunds to the tune of sixty-five billion rupees have been made to the exporters, expressing the determination that in future the refunds will be made in a timely manner. He said we will also go towards providing electricity to the industries on competitive rates in order to enhance their productivity.

He said the platform of Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) has been established to give impetus to the investment. He said the second phase of CPEC will be taken forward.

As regards tax reforms, the Prime Minister said the FBR will be totally restructured. He said consultants will be hired next month for complete digitalization of the tax collection body. Referring to low tax to GDP ratio, he said we will have to enhance the tax base.

The Prime Minister stated that the leading taxpayers and exporters are the heroes of this country. He announced that the recipients of today's awards, consisting of exporters and taxpayers, will be issued blue passports, ARY News reported.

The comments came after the IMF agreed to a staff-level agreement with Islamabad which, if approved by its board, would disburse the last tranche of USD 1.1 billion under an existing USD 3 billion standby arrangement.

Notably, the IMF mission that visited Islamabad for five days on the last review of the stand-by programme said Pakistani authorities expressed interest in yet another bailout.

The stand-by arrangement expires on April 11.

Ahead of the stand-by arrangement, Pakistan had to meet IMF conditions including revising its budget, and raising interest rates, as well as generating revenue through more taxes and hiking electricity and gas prices, ARY News reported.

The International Monetary Fund confirmed that Pakistan was seeking a 24th medium-term bailout package for a permanent push towards longstanding structural reforms, reported Dawn.

The IMF confirmed this while announcing the staff-level agreement on the successful completion of the existing short-term facility.

The IMF, in its end-of-mission statement, said that subject to the approval of its executive board, the staff-level agreement would enable Pakistan to access about USD 1.1 billion--828 million special drawing rights (SDR) - by late April.

Pakistani police say 5 Chinese nationals and their local driver were killed in a suicide attack,"['Riaz Khan', 'Associated Press']","Police officers examine the site of suicide bombing at a highway in Shangla, a district in the Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Tuesday, March 26, 2024.

PESHAWAR – A suicide bomber in northwest Pakistan rammed his explosive-laden car into a vehicle Tuesday, killing five Chinese nationals and their Pakistani driver, police and government officials said.

The attack happened in Shangla, a district in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, local police chief Bakhat Zahir said. He added that the five killed were construction workers and engineers heading to the Dasu Dam, the biggest hydropower project in Pakistan, where they worked.

Authorities said the bodies were transported to a nearby hospital, and that security forces started a search in the area to look for accomplices. Police also launched an investigation into the attack.

No group claimed responsibility, but suspicion is likely to fall on Baluch separatists, who have claimed previous such attacks.

Tuesday’s attack came less than a week after Pakistani security forces killed eight Baluchistan Liberation Army militants who opened fire on a convoy carrying Chinese citizens outside the Chinese-funded Gwadar port in the volatile southwestern Baluchistan province.

The BLA wants independence from the central government in Islamabad.

Pakistan's top political and military leadership denounced the attack.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the Chinese Embassy where he met with the Chinese ambassador, Jiang Zaidong, a government statement said. It said that Sharif condemned the attack, saying those who orchestrated the attack would be punished and a high-level investigation will be conducted into the attack.

“The sympathies of the entire nation, including me, are with the families of the Chinese citizens"" who were killed in the attack, he said.

In a statement, the Chinese Embassy condemned the attack and said it has requested Pakistan to “thoroughly investigate the attack and severely punish the perpetrators.”

Earlier, Pakistan's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also condemned the attack in a statement on Tuesday and offered condolences to the families of the deceased. He wrote: “The enemy has targeted Chinese citizens who are the friends of Pakistan,” without elaborating who he was referring to. He also vowed to ”deal with an iron hand"" those responsible, and expressed hope the attack wouldn't negatively impact Pakistani-Chinese relations.

Naqvi also visited the Chinese Embassy in the capital, Islamabad, where he briefed the Chinese ambassador about the attack, promising a full investigation, according to the Ministry of Interior.

Also Tuesday, Pakistan's military denounced the attack.

“Such heinous acts of violence against innocent civilians, foreigners and the armed forces will not deter the resolve of the Pakistani people, its security forces and our partners to root out the menace (of) terrorism from our country,” it said in a statement.

Thousands of Chinese nationals work in Shangla on projects relating to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which includes a multitude of megaprojects such as road construction, power plants and agriculture.

The CPEC, also known as the One Road Project, is a lifeline for Pakistan’s cash-strapped government, currently facing one of its worst economic crises. The project is part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a global endeavor aimed at reconstituting the Silk Road and linking China to all corners of Asia.

Chinese laborers working on CPEC-related projects in Pakistan have come under attack in recent years.

In July 2021, at least 13 people, including nine Chinese nationals, were killed when a suicide bomber detonated his vehicle near a bus carrying several Chinese and Pakistani engineers and laborers, prompting the Chinese companies to suspend work at the time.

Since then, Pakistan has beefed up security on CPEC-related projects.

"Pakistan Sponsoring Terrorism At Almost An ""Industry Level"": S Jaishankar",[],"In India now, Mr Jaishankar said, ""The mood is not to overlook terrorists"" (File)

Underlining that Pakistan is sponsoring terrorism at almost an ""industry level"", External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday asserted that the mood in India now is not to overlook terrorists and it ""will not skirt this problem anymore"".

Mr Jaishankar, who is on a three-day visit to Singapore, made these remarks during a Q&A round held post his lecture session on his authored book 'Why Bharat Matters' at Institute of South Asian Studies (ISAS) of the National University of Singapore (NUS).

""Every country wants a stable neighbourhood...if nothing else you want at least a quiet neighbourhood,"" he said in response to a question on India's ties with Pakistan.

However, unfortunately, it is not the same with India, he said.

Underlining that Pakistan has been sponsoring terrorism against India, Mr Jaishankar asked, ""How do you deal with a neighbour who does not hide the fact that they use terrorism as an instrument of statecraft?"" ""It's not a one-off happening...but very sustained, almost at an industry level...So what we have come to conclude is that we have to find a way of addressing (the menace), that dodging the problem gets us nowhere, it only invites more trouble,"" he said.

""I don't have a quick instantaneous fix (to this issue). But what I can tell you is that India will not skirt this problem anymore. We are not going to say, 'well, that happened and let's continue our dialogue'...we have a problem and we must be honest enough to face up to that problem, however difficult it is...we should not give the other country a free pass, saying there's nothing they can do about it or it's a very hard problem, or there's so much else at stake that let us overlook,"" he asserted.

In India now, Mr Jaishankar said, ""The mood is not to overlook terrorists"".

Pakistan cricketer Imad Wasim comes out of retirement for ICC T20 World Cup,[],"The all-rounder has made himself availble for Pakistan’s squad for the ICC T20 World Cup in June after a successful stint with Islamabad United in the PSL.

Pakistan all-rounder Imad Wasim has announced he would come out of retirement to play in this year’s Twenty20 World Cup, four months after ending his international career.

The 35-year-old left-handed batsman and off-spinner anchored Islamabad United’s title triumph in the Pakistan Super League (PSL), where he took five wickets and made an undefeated 19. He took 12 wickets and scored 126 runs during Islamabad’s 12 matches in the league.

“I’m happy to announce that after meeting PCB [Pakistan Cricket Board] officials, I have reconsidered my retirement and am delighted to declare my availability for Pakistan leading up to the T20 World Cup,” Wasim wrote in a post on social media on Saturday.

I am happy to announce that pursuant to meeting PCB officials, I have reconsidered my retirement and am delighted to declare my availability for Pakistan cricket in T20i format leading up to ICC T20i World Cup 2024.

Wasim has played 55 one-day internationals and 66 Twenty20s for Pakistan but his fitness and attitude were often called into question by selectors.

He was part of Pakistan’s Twenty20 set-up in the series against New Zealand in April last year but his cut from the squad for the 50-over World Cup in October and November prompted him to call time on his international career.

Pakistan are due to play a five-match home T20 series against New Zealand next month before touring Ireland and England for six more matches ahead of the World Cup.

The 20-team T20 World Cup takes place in the United States and West Indies from June 1.

Pakistan will play their opening match against archrivals India on June 9 in New York, while their other group matches are slated against Canada (June 11) and Ireland on June 16.","{'https://news.google.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AP23328576416863-1711259883.jpg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80', 'https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AP23328576416863-1711259883.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440', 'https://news.google.com/static/media/aj-footer-logo.bac952ad.svg'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vc3BvcnRzLzIwMjQvMy8yNC9pbWFkLXdhc2ltLXBha2lzdGFuLXJldGlyZW1lbnQtdDIwLXdvcmxkLWN1cC1wc2wtYWxsLXJvdW5kZXLSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9zcG9ydHMvMjAyNC8zLzI0L2ltYWQtd2FzaW0tcGFraXN0YW4tcmV0aXJlbWVudC10MjAtd29ybGQtY3VwLXBzbC1hbGwtcm91bmRlcg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1

Dar called for early resumption of PIA flights between Pakistan and the UK to further boost linkages, particularly in view of the large Pakistani diaspora in the Britain.

The PIA flight operations had been suspended by several countries, including the UK, in July 2020 owing to concerns over pilots’ licencing authenticity.



They also discussed important regional issues including Afghanistan and the situation in Gaza. The foreign minister invited Lord Cameron to visit Pakistan.

He thanked the British foreign secretary for his message of felicitations on his appointment as the foreign minister and said he looked forward to working closely with the UK leadership to further strengthen bilateral ties.

Suspension of PIA's international operations

Prior to this development, Dar took up the same issue during his high-level engagements in London with UK Minister of State for South Asia and Commonwealth Lord Tariq Ahmad and Minister of State for Development Andrew Mitchell at the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office a few days ago.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was keen to resume PIA flight operations in the Britain, the foreign minister said in a press conference on Saturday, adding that Islamabad has taken effective steps to remove hurdles in the national flag carrier’s international flight operations by completing concerned inspections, and updating the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) law in accordance with the global requirements.

The country’s aviation authority expressed hope last week that the state-owned airline’s flights to the UK is expected to resume in May as all inspections have been concluded.","{'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/Menu-blue.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2024-03-25/536465_2483203_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/detail-twitter.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2024-03-25/536465_6685265_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/reporters/796_082353_reporter.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/detail-whatsapp.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/placeholders/700x390.png', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/detail-facebook.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2024-03-25/l_536465_082201_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/geo-logo.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv//assets/front/images/geo-logo.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/GEO-TV-ICONS2.png', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/GEO-TV-ICONS1.png', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/GEO-TV-ICONS2-70X32.png'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdlby50di9sYXRlc3QvNTM2NDY1LXBha2lzdGFuLXNlZWtzLWVhcmx5LXJlc3VtcHRpb24tb2YtcGlhLWZsaWdodHMtdG8tdWvSAVJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nZW8udHYvYW1wLzUzNjQ2NS1wYWtpc3Rhbi1zZWVrcy1lYXJseS1yZXN1bXB0aW9uLW9mLXBpYS1mbGlnaHRzLXRvLXVr?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1
Geneva event highlights plight of minorities in Pakistan occupied Kashmir,[],"In a key event held at the Palais des Nations in Geneva on March 22, the National Equality Party Jammu Kashmir, Gilgit Baltistan and Ladakh (NEP-JKGBL) organised a side event aimed at spotlighting the challenges faced by minorities in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The panellists included Professor Nicolas Levrat, Konstantin Bogdanos, Tsenge Tsering, Humphrey Hawksley and Sajjad Raja, at an event which saw Joseph Chongsi as moderator.

Bogdanos, a Greek politician, stressed the criticality of raising awareness among politicians and citizens worldwide about the challenges confronting minorities, even in geographically distant regions.

He vehemently criticised Pakistan's policies, particularly regarding minority treatment and the militarisation of the region, drawing parallels from his own experiences in Northern Cyprus and emphasising the necessity of collective action.

He pointed to the ""deliberate suppression of political discourse in the region"" which is ""alarming"".

Tsenge Tsering, hailing from Gilgit-Baltistan, provided first-hand insights into the situation. Despite economic prosperity, the local populace grapples with poverty, inadequate infrastructure, and food security risks. Tsering decried the lack of constitutional rights and representation for the majority population in the territory.

"Historic Win Shatters Stereotypes, Empowers Women in Pakistani Politics",['Benazir Samad'],"When Suriya Bibi was running for a seat earlier this year on the Khyber Pakhtunkwa provincial assembly, she faced numerous challenges beyond being a woman and hailing from a minority sect in Pakistan's remote district of Chitral.

Another obstacle appeared when the Election Commission randomly assigned a hen symbol as her identifier on ballot papers — such symbols are tools to aid illiterate voters. In January, Pakistan's Supreme Court barred her political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, from using the cricket bat symbol associated with former Prime Minister Imran Khan.

The hen symbol inadvertently perpetuated the stereotype that women in Chitral were better suited for poultry farming than politics. Her opponents capitalized on their good luck, ridiculing her and mocking the symbol's association with domesticity.

In a phone interview with VOA, Bibi said that there was no shame in poultry farming and rejected the attempt to diminish her worth based on her election symbol.

History made

Bibi made history in early February by becoming the first woman from Chitral district to secure an assembly seat through a direct election rather than assuming a seat reserved for women, as is customary in the region. Not only did she clinch victory in the PK-1 constituency in Chitral with a decisive majority, but she also ascended to the position of deputy speaker in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assembly.

In Pakistan, where women's involvement in governance is often restricted, Bibi encountered obstacles while navigating and challenging traditional norms to carve out her place in male-dominated politics.

According to social critic and feminist writer Sabahat Zakariya, Bibi belongs to the rare category of women parliamentarians who have secured their positions through open seats without relying on the political influence or lineage of male family members.

“Currently, all the big female names in Pakistani politics are scions of big feudal or industrial political families,” Zakariya said. “In that, Suriya Bibi’s achievement is not just unique for Chitral but also [for] all of Pakistan.”

Campaigning in rough terrain

Bibi also reflected on how the severe winters and the daunting terrain of the Hindukush mountains presented yet another challenge to her campaign.

Dilapidated roads and inadequate infrastructure made reaching the remote areas of her constituency difficult. Spanning approximately 210 kilometers (about 130 miles), the upper Chitral PK-1 district encompasses the farthest village, Broghil, which borders the Badakhshan province of Afghanistan.

“Sometimes, I had to walk kilometers on foot when there were no roads for vehicles,"" she said. ""Despite facing these difficulties and even being unwell at times, I remained dedicated to connecting with people and meeting voters. The support of women who walked with me provided comfort and bolstered my determination throughout this demanding campaign.”

Bibi grew up with both her father and a grandfather engaged in local politics and knew that she, too, wanted to be a politician.

“Despite my family's support for another party, I made an independent choice and joined Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, PTI party, [which means] 'Pakistan movement for justice,' in 2007,” she said.

“Joining politics, I initially faced resistance and received criticism for participating in protests and rallies, as it wasn't common for women in the conservative region like Chitral to break through a male-dominated field like politics.”

Starting as a grassroots worker, Bibi began by mobilizing women at the village level, then represented Chitral as a female leader and then became the vice president of PTI Malakand Division. So, she ascended through the ranks within her party before getting a nomination to run for election from the party.

Bibi’s campaign efforts encouraging women to go out and vote resulted in women surpassing male votes for the first time in the region’s history. In total, 35,377 women voted, compared with the 30,345 votes from men.

In Chitral, where no local woman had previously secured an electoral victory and where her opponents wielded greater financial resources, Bibi initially doubted her chances.

“Men establish connections, friendships, and network with party officials, gaining exposure and influence,"" she said. ""However, as a woman, I couldn't do the same. Despite these challenges and cultural norms, I only had dedication and the unwavering support of my family, particularly my husband. He consistently encouraged me when I was nominated to run for the seat, urging me to take it up as a challenge.”

Speaking about her plans, Bibi said her focus would be on tackling property rights issues for women and prioritizing girls' education. Given her background as an educator, she eagerly anticipates establishing a nursing school in the region, recognizing that young women who pursue nursing careers often must move far from their families.

Aspiring female students have begun approaching her about internship opportunities in her office, she said, reflecting a shift in the perception that politics are exclusively dominated by powerful men.

She said her political journey shows how even an ordinary middle-class woman like herself can ascend to great heights in the realm of politics.

"FM Dar eyes early resumption of PIA flights between Pakistan, UK",[],"Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar (left), and British Foreign Secretary David Cameron. — AFP

Calling for an end to nearly four-year suspension of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) international flight operations, Foreign Minister Ishaq on Monday urged early resumption of the national flag carrier’s direct flights to the United Kingdom (UK).



In a telephone call today, the foreign minister talked to British Foreign Secretary David Cameron in which he emphasised early conclusion of Enhanced Strategic Partnership agreement between the two countries to further strengthen the bilateral ties, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Monday.

Reiterating the importance of Pakistan-UK relations, Dar said both countries have longstanding, historic relations with multifaceted cooperation.

"Jaishankar says terrorism in Pakistan at 'industry level', speaks on dual citizenship to OCI card holders",[],"From China and Pakistan to Arunachal Pradesh and citizenship to OCI Card — External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar spoke on a host of issues during a question and answer round held following his lecture session on his authored book 'Why Bharat Matters'. The lecture was held at the Institute of South Asian Studies (ISAS) of National University of Singapore (NUS) on Saturday.

Here's what Jaishankar said | Top 5 points

1. On plans to improve relationship with Pakistan

Jaishankar said Pakistan is sponsoring terrorism at almost an ""industry level"". asked, ""How do you deal with a neighbour who does not hide the fact that they use terrorism as an instrument of statecraft?""

""It's not a one-off happening...but very sustained, almost at an industry level...So what we have come to conclude is that we have to find a way of addressing (the menace),"" he said, adding that dodging the problem ""gets us nowhere, it only invites more trouble.""

He said he doesn't have a ""quick instantaneous fix (to this issue)"". He, however, said India will not skirt this problem anymore. ""We are not going to say, 'well, that happened and let's continue our dialogue'...we have a problem and we must be honest enough to face up to that problem.""

""However difficult it is...we should not give the other country a free pass, saying there's nothing they can do about it or it's a very hard problem, or there's so much else at stake that let us overlook,"" Jaishankar asserted.

2. On troop movements on China borders

Jaishankar linked ""relationship building"" with ""border stabilisation"". He said when China, in 2020, chose to do something on the borders was “complexly violative of agreements we had reached"". He accused China of disturbing ""the foundation of equilibrium"".

""We are not looking at solving the boundary issue but maintaining peace and tranquility on the border,"" he said. He added that ""no sensible government will confirms troop movement, least of all to someone to a foreign newspaper"".

""We are today trying to find a way out...,"" Jaishankar said.

3. On China's claims on Arunachal Pradesh

Jaishankar dismissed China's repeated claims on Arunachal Pradesh as ""ludicrous"" and asserted that the frontier state was a ""natural part of India"". China has been claiming Arunachal Pradesh as South Tibet and has also named the area as ‘Zangnan’.

Responding to such claims, Jaishankar was quoted by PTI as saying, ""This is not a new issue. I mean China has laid claim, it has expanded its claim. The claims are ludicrous to begin with and remain ludicrous today.""

Jaishankar emphasised that Arunachal Pradesh was a ""natural part of India."" He said, ""So, I think we've been very clear, very consistent on this. And I think you know that is something which will be part of the boundary discussions which are taking place.""

4. On India's relation with Russia and the US

Jaishankar described India’s relationship with Russia and the US as a ""multi-vector"" policy and said it was possible to deal with each one on a ""non-exclusive"" basis because of India's strong non-alliance culture.

He said, ""On Russia-US, when I said multi-vector policy today, this is something which every, certainly every significant country is going to face. Which is, if you have conflicting interests, if you have different partners, if you are vested in relationships, which often appear to be at cross purposes with each other, how do you actually reconcile this?

""And the answer is clearly, to find ways by which each one of them is dealt with on a non-exclusive basis,"" Jaishankar said.

5. On dual citizenship to OCI card holders

Jaishankar said, ""OCI was something decided up during Atalji's time...People give us ideas…but I am not aware of any specific discussion beyond that what do we do. I think people are still mulling it over...""

China demands probe into Pakistan bombing that killed 5 nationals,[],"China has condemned a bomb attack in northwest Pakistan that killed five Chinese nationals working on a major dam construction site.

Police said on Tuesday that at least five Chinese nationals and their local driver were killed when a bomber rammed his explosives-laden car into their convoy.

It was on the main highway linking Pakistan to China.

The Chinese Embassy in Islamabad issued a statement in connection with the bombing.

“The Chinese Embassy and consulates in Pakistan strongly condemn this terrorist act, and express deep condolences for the victims of both countries and extend sincere sympathies to the families of the victims,” the statement said.

It also urged Pakistani authorities to “take practical and effective measures to protect the safety of Chinese citizens, institutions, and projects to prevent such incidents from happening again.”

“The Chinese Embassy and consulates in Pakistan have immediately launched emergency work, demanding that the Pakistani side conduct a thorough investigation into the attack, severely punish the perpetrators, and take practical and effective measures to protect the safety of Chinese citizens.”

There was no claim of responsibility for one of the deadliest attacks on Chinese nationals in recent years.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the Chinese Embassy to offer condolences over the death of Chinese nationals, his office said.

President Asif Ali Zardari also condemned the attack and expressed “deep grief” over the death of the Chinese nationals. “Anti-Pakistan elements will never succeed in damaging Pak-China friendship.”

This is not the first time Chinese nationals have come under attack in the mountainous region.

In mid-2021, a car bombing targeted a bus convoy of Chinese engineers working on the biggest hydropower project in Pakistan. Nine Chinese nationals and three of their local co-workers were killed.

Most of Chinese engineers working in Pakistan are associated with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which is an extension of Beijing’s global Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure program.","{'https://news.google.com/custom/images/youtube-complex.png', 'https://news.google.com/custom/images/site/LOGO.gif', 'https://cdn.presstv.ir/Photo/2024/3/26/5a8cc295-1570-4776-8052-429fda651662.jpg', 'https://cdn.presstv.ir/Photo/2024/2/5/eb4ea083-813a-416b-bad1-cab592e995aa.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/custom/images/site/Telegram.png', 'https://news.google.com/custom/images/LOGO-NEW1.png', 'https://cdn.presstv.ir/Photo/2024/3/23/42141769-4fe5-49f3-9028-6f579eb45830.jpg', 'https://cdn.presstv.ir/Photo/2024/2/7/3dc04ee6-2ff0-4be9-847c-1aeaf22ddcfd.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/custom/images/presstvradio.png', 'https://cdn.presstv.ir/Photo/2024/3/21/a6dd7a9c-9c5a-4fa2-8b32-b454abd10fe1.jpg', 'https://cdn.presstv.ir/Photo/2024/3/26/b54d743e-2e40-48be-b81b-e0cbe538095a.jpg', 'https://cdn.presstv.ir/Photo/2024/2/20/4d0fe48b-5ebe-4d91-83c4-de9f3e93a2fa.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/custom/images/site/live2.gif', 'https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=I6qat1Y1Mn20Io', 'https://news.google.com/custom/images/facebook-complex.png', 'https://cdn.presstv.ir/Photo/2024/1/30/ebbfb6ea-3623-458d-a961-94a645e7dca1.png', 'https://cdn.presstv.ir/Photo/2024/3/18/e25c8405-c325-403f-bcc6-a77b488820f7.jpg', 'https://cdn.presstv.ir/Photo/2024/2/22/ae68e553-6eec-409e-9986-80d83d9872ec.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/custom/images/twitter-complex.png', 'https://cdn.presstv.ir/Photo/2024/3/10/06d2f428-edad-4f13-b3d5-c37427db9419.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/custom/images/site/Rumble.png', 'https://news.google.com/custom/images/logo-app/LOGO_192x192.jpg'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXNzdHYuaXIvRGV0YWlsLzIwMjQvMDMvMjYvNzIyNTU0L1Bha2lzdGFuLUNoaW5hLWJvbWJpbmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1
Pakistani police say 5 Chinese nationals and their local driver were killed in a suicide attack,"['Riaz Khan', 'Associated Press']","PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — A suicide bomber in northwest Pakistan rammed his explosive-laden car into a vehicle Tuesday, killing five Chinese nationals and their Pakistani driver, police and government officials said.

The attack happened in Shangla, a district in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, local police chief Bakhat Zahir said. He added that the five killed were construction workers and engineers heading to the Dasu Dam, the biggest hydropower project in Pakistan, where they worked.

Authorities said the bodies were transported to a nearby hospital, and that security forces started a search in the area to look for accomplices. Police also launched an investigation into the attack.

No group claimed responsibility, but suspicion is likely to fall on Baluch separatists, who have claimed previous such attacks.

Tuesday’s attack came less than a week after Pakistani security forces killed eight Baluchistan Liberation Army militants who opened fire on a convoy carrying Chinese citizens outside the Chinese-funded Gwadar port in the volatile southwestern Baluchistan province.

The BLA wants independence from the central government in Islamabad.

Pakistan’s top political and military leadership denounced the attack.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the Chinese Embassy where he met with the Chinese ambassador, Jiang Zaidong, a government statement said. It said that Sharif condemned the attack, saying those who orchestrated the attack would be punished and a high-level investigation will be conducted into the attack.

“The sympathies of the entire nation, including me, are with the families of the Chinese citizens” who were killed in the attack, he said.

In a statement, the Chinese Embassy condemned the attack and said it has requested Pakistan to “thoroughly investigate the attack and severely punish the perpetrators.”

Earlier, Pakistan’s Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also condemned the attack in a statement on Tuesday and offered condolences to the families of the deceased. He wrote: “The enemy has targeted Chinese citizens who are the friends of Pakistan,” without elaborating who he was referring to. He also vowed to ”deal with an iron hand” those responsible, and expressed hope the attack wouldn’t negatively impact Pakistani-Chinese relations.

Naqvi also visited the Chinese Embassy in the capital, Islamabad, where he briefed the Chinese ambassador about the attack, promising a full investigation, according to the Ministry of Interior.

Also Tuesday, Pakistan’s military denounced the attack.

“Such heinous acts of violence against innocent civilians, foreigners and the armed forces will not deter the resolve of the Pakistani people, its security forces and our partners to root out the menace (of) terrorism from our country,” it said in a statement.

Thousands of Chinese nationals work in Shangla on projects relating to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which includes a multitude of megaprojects such as road construction, power plants and agriculture.

The CPEC, also known as the One Road Project, is a lifeline for Pakistan’s cash-strapped government, currently facing one of its worst economic crises. The project is part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a global endeavor aimed at reconstituting the Silk Road and linking China to all corners of Asia.

Chinese laborers working on CPEC-related projects in Pakistan have come under attack in recent years.

In July 2021, at least 13 people, including nine Chinese nationals, were killed when a suicide bomber detonated his vehicle near a bus carrying several Chinese and Pakistani engineers and laborers, prompting the Chinese companies to suspend work at the time.

Since then, Pakistan has beefed up security on CPEC-related projects.

"No Need for US Waiver to Build Gas Pipeline With Iran, Pakistan Says",['Sarah Zaman'],"Pakistan said Thursday that it does not need a waiver from U.S. sanctions to build its portion of a pipeline to import natural gas from Iran.

""It is a segment of the pipeline which is being built inside Pakistani territory. So, we do not believe that at this point there is room for any discussion or waiver from a third party,"" Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said in response to a VOA question at the weekly news briefing.

Donald Lu, U.S. assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia, said Wednesday that the department was monitoring the planned pipeline between Iran and Pakistan. He told a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee that Islamabad had not requested a sanctions waiver to conduct gas trade with Iran.

""We have also not heard from the government of Pakistan [on a] desire for any waiver for American sanctions that would certainly result from such a project,"" Lu said.

Last month, Pakistan's outgoing caretaker government gave approval to begin construction of an 80-kilometer section of the pipeline, largely to avoid paying Iran billions of dollars in penalties for years of delays on the $7 billion project.

Pipeline's history

Pakistan and Iran have been in talks to build a gas pipeline between the two countries since the mid-1990s.

The two sides signed a Gas Sales and Purchase Agreement in June 2009 for a pipeline that would supply 750 million to 1 billion cubic feet per day of gas to energy-starved Pakistan from Iran's South Pars Field.

The two sides held an inauguration ceremony at the border in 2013 for construction on the Pakistani side. Iran had already begun work on its side in 2010.

While Iran claimed it had completed construction of 900 kilometers of the pipeline on its side by 2011, construction has not started on Pakistani side until now.

Islamabad suspended the project multiple times as officials cited concerns that Pakistan would invite U.S. sanctions for importing energy from Iran. Tehran faces U.S. banking sanctions for its nuclear program.

Over the years, Iran repeatedly threatened to take Pakistan into international arbitration and slap it with a penalty of nearly $18 billion for breach of contract. Just as time was running out for Islamabad to meet Tehran's deadline of commencing construction by March 2024, the country's outgoing government green-lighted the project.

In the approved first phase, Pakistan will construct an 80-kilometer section of the pipeline from its border with Iran to its port city of Gwadar in the southwestern province of Balochistan.

Pipeline's future

Pakistan spent more than $17 billion on energy imports last year. It was a reduction from prior years as demand for fuel fell with rising inflation.

According to the International Energy Agency, natural gas makes up the largest proportion of Pakistan's energy portfolio. Nearly a third of it is imported.

Although Pakistan does not need a sanctions waiver from Washington to build the pipeline, it will require it to buy Iranian energy.

Washington-based security affairs expert Kamran Bokhari told VOA that while Pakistan could build the case for a waiver from Washington to buy gas from Iran, it has little room to negotiate.

""Pakistan has very little leverage right now because Pakistan has too many asks of the U.S. because of its economic, financial situation,” he said.

Pakistan's internal and external debt is ballooning. The country is on its way to seeking a 24th bailout from the International Monetary Fund.

Bokhari said Washington would also be unwilling to allow any arrangement for Pakistan that could help Iran.

""[The] United States is locked in a very strategic regional struggle with the Iranians, and they need to be able to make sure that the Iranians do not get breathing space,” he said.

Countries that purchase energy products from Iran do so in limited quantities to avoid U.S. sanctions.

Naeem Yahya Mir, former managing director of state-run Pakistan State Oil, told VOA that Pakistan could bypass U.S. banking sanctions by not paying for Iranian gas with dollars.

""If you negotiate, they [Iran] have been doing barter … also it is in their [Iran's] interest to open this market,” Mir said. “It's a mutual benefit.""

In June 2023, Pakistan authorized barter trade with Iran as its foreign exchange reserves dipped to dangerously low levels. However, Bokhari does not believe Pakistan can viably barter for Iranian gas in the long run.

Mir, who also served as the technical adviser for Kuwait Petroleum Corporation for nearly three decades, blamed Pakistani bureaucracy for the delay in building the pipeline and failing to request a waiver from Washington to buy gas from Iran.

""It is not the U.S., it is Pakistan's internal decision-making process. … They can't make decisions.""

If Pakistan gets to the second phase of the project with Iran, it will extend the pipeline to the country's southern region, which could be prohibitively expensive for the cash-strapped country.

Lu told the committee it will not be easy for Pakistan to arrange funds for the project.

""Honestly, I don't know where the financing for such a project would come from,” Lu said. “I don't think many international donors will be interested in funding such an endeavor.""

Lu said the U.S. is working with Pakistan to explore other sources of energy, including environmentally friendly options.","{'https://gdb.voanews.com/7F6E2DA2-34F7-4DDD-B6D1-44ECB81350C2.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-1129-08dc4dbc1c20_w160_r1.jpg', 'https://bbg.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/b/ss/bbgrvoaenglish-bbgprod-bbgentityvoa-bbgunitvoaenglish/1/G.4--NS/1159838111?pageName=voa%3aeng%3ar%3aarticle%3ano%20need%20for%20us%20waiver%20to%20build%20gas%20pipeline%20with%20iran%2c%20pakistan%20says%20&c6=no%20need%20for%20us%20waiver%20to%20build%20gas%20pipeline%20with%20iran%2c%20pakistan%20says%20&pangea_version=8.30.0.0.275&v6=D=c6&g=https%3a%2f%2fwww.voanews.com&c1=D=g&v1=D=g&events=event1&c7=no%20need%20for%20us%20waiver%20to%20build%20gas%20pipeline%20with%20iran%2c%20pakistan%20says%20&v7=D=c7&c16=voa%20english&v16=D=c16&c5=s_south-central-asia&v5=D=c5&ch=english&v15=D=ch&c15=D=ch&c4=article&v4=D=c4&c14=7537570&v14=D=c14&c20=no&c17=responsive&v17=D=c17', 'https://news.google.com/Content/responsive/VOA/en-US/img/logo.svg', 'https://news.google.com/Content/responsive/VOA/en-US/img/logo-compact.svg', 'https://news.google.com/Content/responsive/VOA/en-US/img/logo-print_color.png', 'https://news.google.com/Content/responsive/img/player-spinner.png', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-f333-08dc4d199c6a_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-a614-08dc4d99b9c9_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/0602FB04-9F93-4092-B521-09A9E92A9A99_w250_r0_s.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-e90d-08db991c6943_w250_r1_s.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/Content/responsive/VOA/en-US/img/logo-print.gif'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2Evbm8tbmVlZC1mb3ItdXMtd2FpdmVyLXRvLWJ1aWxkLWdhcy1waXBlbGluZS13aXRoLWlyYW4tcGFraXN0YW4tc2F5cy0vNzUzNzU3MC5odG1s0gFtaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm9hbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL25vLW5lZWQtZm9yLXVzLXdhaXZlci10by1idWlsZC1nYXMtcGlwZWxpbmUtd2l0aC1pcmFuLXBha2lzdGFuLXNheXMtLzc1Mzc1NzAuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1

Indian-Pakistan lesbian couple break up weeks before wedding; Anjali Chakra says ‘Sufi Malik cheated on her’,"['Tribune Web Desk', 'About The Author']","Tribune Web Desk

Chandigarh, March 26

Anjali Chakra and Sufi Malik--the two Indian and Pakistani social media influencers--have called off their marriage and decided to cut cords.

In separate posts on Instagram, they said the reason behind them parting ways was ""infidelity committed by Sufi"".

The same-sex couple won hearts on the internet in 2019 after they shared pictures and videos of them wearing traditional South Asian outfits and dancing under the rain.

“This may come as a shock, but our journey is shifting. We have decided to call off our wedding and end our relationship due to infidelity committed by Sufi,"" Anjali said in a post adding that she wished for ""absolutely no negativity"" to be directed toward Malik.

Sufi also took to Instagram to share a post about the split, admitting to cheating on her fiancee, a few weeks before their wedding was scheduled to take place.

“I made an unrecognisable mistake of betrayal by cheating on her a few weeks before our wedding. I've hurt her tremendously, beyond my understanding. I am owning up to my mistake and will continue to do so. I've hurt the people I love and care about the most through my actions, including our family and friends; our community that I cherish,"" she wrote.

The couple, who had been together for over five years and got engaged to be married a year ago.

However, some fans speculated the split was a prank.

Pakistan: 5 Chinese nationals killed in suicide bomb attack,['Smriti Mishra'],"(Image for representation)

Five Chinese nationals were killed in an explosion when their convoy was attacked by a suicide bomber in northwest Pakistan on March 26, Reuters reported.

The suicide bomber rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a convoy of Chinese engineers moving from Islamabad to their camp in Dasu in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Reuters quoted regional police chief Mohammad Ali Gandapur as saying.

""Five Chinese nationals and their Pakistani driver were killed in the attack,"" Mohammad Ali Gandapur said.

Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the Chinese embassy in Islamabad and offered condolences over the death of Chinese nationals.

Dasu is the site of a major dam and the area has been attacked in the past. A blast on a bus had killed 13 people, including nine Chinese nationals, in 2021.

The incident took place hours after Pakistan's second-largest naval air station located in Turbat, was attacked -- killing at least one paramilitary soldier while security forces killed all five of the assailants in retaliatory fire

The Majeed Brigade of separatist group Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the assault.

The attack on the Turbat base in southwestern Pakistan was the second assault by ethnic Baloch militants on a military facility in the past week.

""We escaped a huge loss,"" said a statement from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's office.

The naval base is significant to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor that also encompasses roads and energy projects and is part of Chinese President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative.

"Pakistan’s Gwadar port attacked, eight armed fighters killed",['Abid Hussain'],"Security forces fought for two hours before the attackers were killed, at a facility that is a showpiece project and is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

Islamabad, Pakistan — Pakistan’s security forces foiled a major attack in Gwadar, a port city in the southwestern province of Balochistan, when eight armed fighters were killed on Wednesday when they tried to enter the Gwadar Port Authority complex.

The facility is a centrepiece of the multibillion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Pakistan’s most ambitious infrastructure and investment project in recent years.

Saeed Ahmed Umrani, a senior government official, confirmed that the port complex was attacked, and said the security forces were engaged in nearly two hours of fighting with the attackers before they were killed.

“At least two men from security forces were injured in the fighting. The operation has been completed but clearance of the area is still ongoing,” he told Al Jazeera.

Chief Minister of Balochistan Sarfraz Bugti said in a message on X: “Whosoever chooses to use violence will see no mercy from the state. Kudos to all law enforcement bravehearts who fought bravely today for Pakistan.”

Eight terrorists tried to attack the Gwadar Port Authority complex today. All of them have been neutralised by security forces. The message is loud & clear. Whosoever chooses to use violence will see no mercy from the state. Kudos to all law enforcement bravehearts who fought… — Sarfraz Bugti (@PakSarfrazbugti) March 20, 2024

The attack was claimed by Majeed Brigade, the armed wing of the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist group that demands secession of the province from Pakistan.

In a statement, the BLA said that the offices of Pakistan’s intelligence agencies inside the complex were targeted. “BLA accepts responsibility for the attack and further details will be released to the media,” the statement said.

One eyewitness in Gwadar city told Al Jazeera that the attack started around 4pm local time.

“First there were two major explosions, which were followed by loud, long bursts of firing which continued for more than hour,” the Gwadar resident told Al Jazeera on the phone, requesting anonymity.

He further said that the complex where the attack unfolded was partly a residential area where mostly staff working on the port lived, but it also had some other government offices.

This was not the first time that Gwadar has been attacked. The city is home to many Chinese citizens who are working on the construction of the port.

In August last year, two gunmen targeted a convoy of 23 Chinese engineers in Gwadar, but they were killed by security forces. That attack was also claimed by the Majeed Brigade of the BLA.

There was another major attack in Gwadar five years ago in 2019, when three attackers launched an audacious charge at the only luxury hotel in the city, situated on top of a hill on the coastline.

The attack, which was also claimed by the BLA, led to the killing of five people, including one Pakistan Navy officer.

Gwadar is a town on Pakistan’s southwestern coast and is undergoing developmental projects carried out with help from Chinese engineers and financed by the Chinese government. It is home to the country’s only deep-sea port.

The projects are part of the CPEC, a $62bn trade corridor that links southwestern China to the Arabian Sea through Pakistan, including major roads and the port in strategically important Balochistan province.

Home to about 15 million of Pakistan’s estimated 240 million people, according to the 2023 census, Balochistan is also the country’s poorest province, despite being rich in natural resources, including oil, coal, gold, copper and gas reserves.

Baloch secessionist groups such as the BLA initially wanted a share of provincial resources, but later initiated a movement for complete independence. Balochistan is Pakistan’s largest but least populous province, and has had a long history of marginalisation. The province was annexed by Pakistan in 1948, soon after partition from India, and there has been a separatist movement ever since.","{'https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/nadeem-khawer-1710945306.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440', 'https://news.google.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/nadeem-khawer-1710945306.jpg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80', 'https://news.google.com/static/media/aj-footer-logo.bac952ad.svg'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDI0LzMvMjAvcGFraXN0YW5zLWd3YWRhci1wb3J0LWF0dGFja2VkLWVpZ2h0LWFybWVkLWZpZ2h0ZXJzLWtpbGxlZNIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvMjAyNC8zLzIwL3Bha2lzdGFucy1nd2FkYXItcG9ydC1hdHRhY2tlZC1laWdodC1hcm1lZC1maWdodGVycy1raWxsZWQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1

Woman sentenced to life in prison by Pakistan court for burning pages from Islam’s holy book,['The Associated Press'],"A court in Pakistan sentenced a Muslim woman to life in prison after finding her guilty of burning pages of Islam’s holy book, a prosecutor said Friday.

Under Pakistan’s blasphemy laws, anyone found guilty of insulting the religion or religious figures can be sentenced up to death. While authorities have yet to carry out a death sentence for blasphemy, just the accusation can provoke riots.

Government prosecutor Mohazib Awais said the woman, Aasiya Bibi, was arrested in 2021 on blasphemy charges after residents claimed she desecrated the Quran by burning its pages.

Awais said the judge announced the verdict Wednesday in the eastern city of Lahore. He said Bibi, who has the right to appeal, had denied the charge during her trial.

A Christian woman with the same name was acquitted of blasphemy in 2019 after she spent eight years on death row in Pakistan. She moved to Canada to escape death threats from Islamic extremists upon her release. Wednesday’s case involved a different woman.

Domestic and international human rights groups say blasphemy allegations have often been used to intimidate religious minorities and to settle personal scores.

Earlier in March, another court in Gujranwala, Punjab province, sentenced a 22-year-old student to death and gave a teenager a life sentence in two separate cases after finding them guilty of insulting Islam’s Prophet Muhammad.","{'https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-03/240322-pakistan-quran-mb-0838-567870.jpg', 'https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-03/240322-pakistan-quran-mb-0838-567870.jpg'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL25ld3Mvd29ybGQvcGFraXN0YW4tcXVyYW4taXNsYW0taG9seS1ib29rLWJ1cm5pbmctbGlmZS1wcmlzb24tcmNuYTE0NDU5NNIBK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYW1wL3JjbmExNDQ1OTQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1
"6 killed, including 5 Chinese nationals, in northwest Pakistan suicide attack, police say",[],"A suicide bomber reportedly attacked a vehicle in northwest Pakistan, killing five Chinese nationals and their Pakistani driver on Tuesday.

The attack occurred in Shangla, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, bordering Afghanistan, where Pakistani Taliban activities have intensified.

This attack follows the killing of eight Baluchistan Liberation Army militants who targeted a convoy carrying Chinese citizens near the Gwadar port.

A suicide bomber in northwest Pakistan rammed his explosive-laden car into a vehicle Tuesday, killing five Chinese nationals and their Pakistani driver, police and government officials said.

The attack happened in Shangla, a district in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, local police chief Bakhat Zahir said. He added that the five killed were construction workers and engineers heading to the Dasu Dam, the biggest hydropower project in Pakistan, where they worked.

The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province borders Afghanistan. The Pakistani Taliban have stepped up attacks there in recent years.

2 CHILDREN DEAD AFTER IRAN BOMBS PAKISTANI SITES IT CLAIMS WERE MILITANT OUTPOSTS

Authorities said the bodies were transported to a nearby hospital, and that security forces started a massive search in the area to look for accomplices. Police also launched an investigation into the attack.

Tuesday’s attack came less than a week after Pakistani security forces killed eight Baluchistan Liberation Army militants who opened fire on a convoy carrying Chinese citizens outside the Chinese-funded Gwadar port in the volatile southwestern Baluchistan province.

The BLA wants independence from the central government in Islamabad.

Pakistan's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the attack in a statement on Tuesday and offered condolences to the families of the deceased. He wrote: ""The enemy has targeted Chinese citizens who are the friends of Pakistan,"" without elaborating who he was referring to. He also vowed to ""deal with an iron hand"" those responsible, and expressed hope the attack wouldn't negatively impact Pakistani-Chinese relations.

Naqvi also visited China's embassy in the capital, Islamabad, where he briefed the Chinese ambassador, Jiang Zaidong, about the attack, promising a full investigation, according to the ministry of interior.

Thousands of Chinese nationals work in Shangla on projects relating to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor which includes a multitude of mega projects such as road construction, power plants and agriculture.

The CPEC, also known as the One Road Project, is a lifeline for Pakistan’s cash-strapped government, currently facing one of the worst economic crises. It is part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a global endeavor aimed at reconstituting the Silk Road and linking China to all corners of Asia.

Chinese laborers working on CPEC-related projects in Pakistan have come under attack in recent years.

In July 2021, at least 13 people, including nine Chinese nationals, were killed when a suicide bomber detonated his vehicle near a bus carrying several Chinese and Pakistani engineers and laborers, prompting the Chinese companies to suspend work at the time.

Since then, Pakistan has beefed up security on CPEC-related projects.","{'https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/25871240-97ab-40d5-b0ad-3ba8fa830eaa/48e50faf-583f-463e-95a0-3cab0406917c/1280x720/match/896/500/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1', 'https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/03/Pakistan-Police.jpg', 'https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/03/1200/675/Pakistan-Police.jpg?ve=1&tl=1', 'https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/antisemitism-exposed-nl.jpg'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3dvcmxkLzYta2lsbGVkLTUtY2hpbmVzZS1uYXRpb25hbHMtbm9ydGh3ZXN0LXBha2lzdGFuLXN1aWNpZGUtYXR0YWNrLXBvbGljZS1zYXnSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3huZXdzLmNvbS93b3JsZC82LWtpbGxlZC01LWNoaW5lc2UtbmF0aW9uYWxzLW5vcnRod2VzdC1wYWtpc3Rhbi1zdWljaWRlLWF0dGFjay1wb2xpY2Utc2F5LmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1
Six killed in suicide bombing of Chinese interests in Pakistan,[],"PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) -- A suicide bomber rammed a vehicle into a convoy of Chinese engineers working on a dam project in northwest Pakistan on Tuesday, killing six people, police said, the third major attack on Chinese interests in the South Asian country in a week.

The first two attacks hit an airbase and a strategic port in the southwest province of Balochistan where China is investing billions in infrastructure projects.

The engineers were on their way from Islamabad to their camp at the dam construction site in Dasu in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Mohammad Ali Gandapur, the regional police chief, told Reuters.

""Five Chinese nationals and their Pakistani driver were killed in the attack,"" Gandapur said.

Dasu is the site of a major dam, and the area has been attacked in the past. A blast on a bus in 2013 killed 13 people, including nine Chinese nationals.

Chinese engineers have been working on a number of projects Pakistan with Beijing investing over $65 billion in infrastructure projects as part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) under its wider Belt and Road initiative.

No one claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack, nor was there a claim for the 2021 attack. Pakistan is home to twin insurgencies -- one by Islamists and the other by ethnic militants seeking secession.

While Chinese interests are primarily targeted by the ethnic militants seeking to push Beijing out of mineral-rich Balochistan, they generally operate in the country's south and southwest -- far from the site of Tuesday's attack.

Islamists mostly operate in the country's northwest, in the area the convoy was attacked.

The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police had reached the spot and started relief operations.

A separate police source told Reuters the convoy was carrying staff of the construction firm China Gezhouba Group Company (CGGC) working on the Dasu hydropower project -- the same company targeted in 2021.

Construction work ceased for months after that attack.

China's embassy in Islamabad did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

The attacks come a week before Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to fly to Beijing, according to a source in the Prime Minister's Office. It will be Sharif's first visit since taking office following elections in February.

Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar condemned the attack and said the country would continue to fight back against militants.","{'https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F7%2F4%2F1%2F1%2F47461147-3-eng-GB%2FCropped-17114543682022-11-16T130525Z_1636208240_RC21NX9EGJ5Z_RTRMADP_3_PAKISTAN-DEFENCE.JPG?width=1260&height=630&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms', 'https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F7%2F4%2F1%2F1%2F47461147-3-eng-GB%2FCropped-17114543682022-11-16T130525Z_1636208240_RC21NX9EGJ5Z_RTRMADP_3_PAKISTAN-DEFENCE.JPG?width=700&fit=cover&gravity=faces&dpr=2&quality=medium&source=nar-cms', 'https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F6%2F1%2F6%2F8%2F47428616-1-eng-GB%2F2024-03-17T073245Z_1980228858_RC2HN6A6NT76_RTRMADP_3_PAKISTAN-ATTACK.JPG?width=240&height=137&fit=cover&gravity=faces&dpr=2&quality=medium&source=nar-cms', 'https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F1%2F9%2F9%2F2%2F47312991-3-eng-GB%2FCropped-17085648922024-02-07T111414Z_1071428086_RC2MH4ASRC3I_RTRMADP_3_PAKISTAN-ELECTION-TRUCKART.JPG?width=240&height=137&fit=cover&gravity=faces&dpr=2&quality=medium&source=nar-cms', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1076130949081971&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'https://news.google.com/bundles/app/images/app-modal.png?ez', 'https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F6%2F0%2F6%2F1%2F47451606-6-eng-GB%2FCropped-17111963362024-03-23T120846Z_2080731539_RC2NR6AWMZ5O_RTRMADP_3_RUSSIA-SHOOTING.JPG?width=240&height=137&fit=cover&gravity=faces&dpr=2&quality=medium&source=nar-cms', 'https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F6%2F9%2F6%2F6%2F47446696-1-eng-GB%2FAP17300129446102.jpg?width=693&height=390&fit=cover&gravity=faces&dpr=2&quality=medium&source=nar-cms', 'https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F0%2F1%2F2%2F0%2F47450210-5-eng-GB%2FCropped-1711134327N+Moscow+shooting.JPG?width=240&height=137&fit=cover&gravity=faces&dpr=2&quality=medium&source=nar-cms', 'https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F5%2F7%2F4%2F4%2F47454475-5-eng-GB%2FCropped-1711350446-03-22T201942Z_1268924164_RC27R6A34VWH_RTRMADP_3_RUSSIA-SHOOTING+%281%29.JPG?width=240&height=137&fit=cover&gravity=faces&dpr=2&quality=medium&source=nar-cms', 'https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fcms-image-bucket-production-ap-northeast-1-a7d2.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fimages%2F2%2F6%2F7%2F5%2F47435762-3-eng-GB%2FCropped-17109150602024-03-15T180549Z_2023535720_RC2HM6A3JFHD_RTRMADP_3_IMF-CYBER.JPG?width=240&height=137&fit=cover&gravity=faces&dpr=2&quality=medium&source=nar-cms'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYS5uaWtrZWkuY29tL1BvbGl0aWNzL1RlcnJvcmlzbS9TaXgta2lsbGVkLWluLXN1aWNpZGUtYm9tYmluZy1vZi1DaGluZXNlLWludGVyZXN0cy1pbi1QYWtpc3RhbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1

Five Chinese nationals killed in suicide bomb attack in Pakistan: Report,[],"Five Chinese nationals and a local were killed in an explosion by a suicide bomber in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, as per a Reuters report. Local police had reached the spot and started relief operations.

The fatalities ensued when the alleged suicide bomber rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a convoy of Chinese engineers which was on its way from Islamabad to their camp in Dasu, Reuters quoted the regional police chief as saying.

""Five Chinese nationals and their Pakistani driver were killed in the attack,"" the top cop said, while adding that the rest of the people in the convoy were safely evacuated.

Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack and asserted, ""Forces hostile to Pakistan will never succeed in harming Pakistan-China friendship.""

In a statement issued by the Pakistani Presidency, he conveyed his condolences to the families of the five Chinese nationals.

Reuters further quoted its police source as stating that the convoy was carrying staff of the construction firm China Gezhouba Group Company (CGGC) working on the Dasu hydropower project - the same company targeted in 2021.

Dasu is the site of a major dam and the area has been attacked in the past. In 2021, a blast on a bus killed had 13 people, including nine Chinese nationals. Pakistan, at the time, paid millions in compensation to the families of the Chinese workers killed. China sent its team to probe the attack.

Also, in August 2023, a convoy of Chinese engineers was attacked in Pakistan's Balochistan province by armed rebels, and an intense gunfight ensued between the rebels and Pakistani security forces for hours.

In another attack, in May 2021, a burqa-clad Baloch woman suicide bomber killed four people, including three Chinese nationals (tutors), in an attack on a minibus carrying staff from the China-built Confucius Institute at Karachi University. The same year, in April 2021, a suicide bomb attack at a luxury hotel hosting the Chinese ambassador in Quetta killed four and wounded dozens.

Chinese nationals have been engaged in a number of projects in Pakistan with its ""all-weather"" ally China having invested billions in infrastructure projects as part of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) under its Belt and Road initiative.

Confirming that the deceased Chinese nationals worked for projects undertaken by CPEC, newly-inducted Pakistan's Privatisation Minister Abdul Aleem Khan said on X, ""The enemy is targeting Pak-China friendship and CPEC under a well-thought-out conspiracy, but the nation will thwart all the nefarious conspiracies along with the Pakistan Army.""

US Opposes Iran-Pakistan Gas Pipeline Project,[],"A senior US official said Washington is against the construction of the planned Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline, warning it would result in US sanctions.

“I fully support the efforts by the US government to prevent this pipeline from happening … We are working toward that goal,” the Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Donald Lu told a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the House of Representatives on Wednesday.

Stressing the need to implement Tehran sanctions, Lu confirmed that the US has been in consultation with Pakistan over the project. “Washington has not received any request from Islamabad regarding sanctions relief, so our efforts to stop Pakistan from Iran’s gas project will continue,” he added.

Iran and Pakistan have recently aimed to revive the gas pipeline project, commonly known as the Peace Pipeline or IP Gas, that has been languishing for more than a decade.

Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch told IRNA, Iranian state news agency, that Islamabad remains committed to the project.

Despite resistance from Western partners, Pakistan has made progress in advancing the project. The initial phase, covering 80 kilometers from Gwadar to the Iranian border, has received government approval and funding.

Last week, Mohsen Khojasteh-Mehr, the CEO of Iran’s National Iranian Oil Company, announced that the negotiations between Tehran and Islamabad are underway regarding the export of Iranian gas to its eastern neighbor. he said, “The will of the two countries is to implement this project,”.

"Ahead of congressional hearing, US worried over Pakistan ‘electoral abuse’",['Abid Hussain'],"Islamabad, Pakistan – A senior United States Department of State official has described Washington’s concerns over “electoral abuse and violence” in the lead-up to Pakistan’s general election last month in written testimony submitted a day before a congressional hearing about relations between the two nations.

Donald Lu, the assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs, said President Joe Biden’s administration identified a series of “irregularities” in the conduct of the February 8 elections as he emphasised the importance of ties between Washington and Islamabad.

A subcommittee of the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the US House of Representatives is holding a hearing on the “future of democracy in Pakistan and the US-Pakistan relationship” on Wednesday. The hearing was announced last week after more than 30 members of Congress wrote to Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, asking them not to recognise Pakistan’s new government under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The February 8 elections were marred by widespread allegations of electoral manipulation, unusually delayed results and rigging.

The State Department had voiced concerns over the elections at the time, but Pakistan has consistently denied the allegations. After criticism from the West, Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on February 10 said it was surprised by the reactions, which failed to “acknowledge the free and enthusiastic exercise of the right to vote by tens of millions of Pakistanis”.

Lu’s comments before the congressional hearing, however, “drill down a bit deeper” on those previous comments, the US diplomat said.

“We were particularly concerned about electoral abuses and violence that happened in the weeks leading up to the elections,” Lu said before detailing attacks by armed groups on security officials and politicians, the harassment of journalists, and the prevention of some political parties and candidates from registering for the elections.

Former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party was barred from using its electoral symbol, a cricket bat, days before the polls when the Election Commission concluded that the party had not held internal elections on time. Khan and many other party leaders are under arrest.

Still, candidates backed by the PTI, who had to run as independents, emerged as the largest bloc in the National Assembly with 93 seats.

The final tally of the results was announced more than 40 hours after polling stations closed, and it showed the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN) and Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) finishing in second and third place with 75 and 54 seats, respectively.

After the PTI’s refusal to form an alliance with either of them, the PMLN, PPP and other smaller partners assembled a coalition to form the government, which is headed by the PMLN’s Sharif, who became prime minister for the second time.

When the congressional hearing into US-Pakistan ties was announced, Islamabad had welcomed the session and said it “believes in constructive engagement on all matters”.

“We respect the prerogative of legislative bodies to discuss and debate international issues,” a Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesperson said last week. On Wednesday, Foreign Ministry officials told Al Jazeera they did not wish to comment further on Lu’s testimony.

But Lu’s statement on the eve of the hearing suggested that the US retains concerns about the conduct of the February 8 elections.

“On the day of the elections, an internationally respected local election monitoring organization said that they were barred from observing vote tabulation in more than half of the constituencies across the country,” Lu wrote in his testimony.

“And despite a high court instruction not to interrupt internet service on election day, authorities shut down mobile data services, the principal means by which Pakistanis access social media and messaging applications,” he further wrote.

Pakistan has defended its decision to cut internet access, pointing to a series of attacks in the lead-up to the vote. The government described the move as part of “security measures [that] are essential to maintain the law and order situation and to deal with potential threats”.

Lu is no stranger to US-Pakistan tensions. Khan, the former Pakistani prime minister, publicly accused the US diplomat of delivering a warning to the then-Pakistani ambassador in Washington, suggesting that the removal of Khan from office would help improve ties. At the time, Khan was strengthening ties with Russia despite its war on Ukraine.

Khan and his PTI government were removed from power in April 2022 through a parliamentary vote of no confidence, a first in Pakistan’s history. The US has repeatedly denied Khan’s allegation that it was involved in any conspiracy to remove him from office.

“They’ve always been false. You’ve heard me say that more than once, more than twice, more than 10 times probably,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said last week.

In January, Khan was sentenced to 10 years in prison along with former Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on accusations of revealing state secrets, a case pertaining to Lu’s alleged message.

In his written statement, Lu emphasised Pakistan’s importance to the US as a partner and said the two countries closely cooperate on threats from armed groups as well as bolstering “respect for human rights, including religious freedom”.

“Most importantly, the United States plays a critical role in promoting economic stability in Pakistan,” the official said.

Pakistan has faced a mounting economic crisis over the past two years and barely averted default through a last minute International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan last year worth $3bn.

Hours before the subcommittee meeting, the US-based IMF confirmed that Pakistan is eligible to receive the remaining $1.1bn from the loan programme and said the country’s “economic and financial position has improved”.","{'https://news.google.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/US-state-department-1710934627.jpg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80', 'https://news.google.com/static/media/aj-footer-logo.bac952ad.svg', 'https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/US-state-department-1710934627.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDI0LzMvMjAvYWhlYWQtb2YtY29uZ3Jlc3Npb25hbC1oZWFyaW5nLXVzLXdvcnJpZWQtb3Zlci1wYWtpc3Rhbi1lbGVjdG9yYWwtYWJ1c2XSAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMjQvMy8yMC9haGVhZC1vZi1jb25ncmVzc2lvbmFsLWhlYXJpbmctdXMtd29ycmllZC1vdmVyLXBha2lzdGFuLWVsZWN0b3JhbC1hYnVzZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1
Pakistan: Extreme weather events exemplify the urgent need to operationalize the Loss and Damage Fund,[],"Responding to the unexpected and deadly rains and snowfall in Pakistan which have resulted in the death of at least 45 people, including at least 27 children, Ann Harrison, Climate Justice Advisor at Amnesty International, said:

“The recent extreme weather events exemplify the acute climate vulnerability that Pakistan faces as well as the lack of preparedness for communities and populations most at risk. The unfortunate huge loss of children’s lives underscores the fact that the young are particularly in danger due to these changes.

Delays to appointing the 26-member board for the Loss and Damage Fund and for it to begin meeting must not be allowed to derail the entire 2024 timeline set out for the operationalization of the fund. Ann Harrison, Climate Justice Advisor at Amnesty International

“Hundreds of homes have been completely destroyed and food crops disrupted by the heavy and unseasonal rains and snowfall in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, areas that are still reeling from the devastating aftermath of the 2022 floods in the country. Amnesty urges the government to not simply provide urgent relief support but also rehabilitative assistance to ensure that communities are able to rebuild their lives and ensure food security.

“This burden is not Pakistan’s to bear alone, the international community must prioritize ensuring the rapid operationalization and capitalization of the international Loss and Damage Fund to ensure that climate-vulnerable countries such as Pakistan are given the support they need to address the unavoidable impacts of climate change that they are not responsible for.

“Delays to appointing the 26-member board for the Loss and Damage Fund and for it to begin meeting must not be allowed to derail the entire 2024 timeline set out for the operationalization of the fund.”

BACKGROUND:

Heavy rainfall and snow across the country has resulted in the loss of 40 lives in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, five deaths in Balochistan and left dozens injured since 26 February. The disasters have also resulted in massive loss of homes, livestock, crops and infrastructures.

An agreement to establish the Loss and Damage Fund was reached at COP27 in 2022. Some states pledged very limited financing to the fund at COP28 in Dubai last year, amounts dwarfed by the total US$7 trillion in subsidies that many states, including some of these donors, provide annually to support the fossil fuel industry.

Billions of dollars of finance are needed to adequately capitalize the Fund so that distribution of funds can begin. Higher income states with the greatest responsibility for historical greenhouse gas emissions and other high income fossil fuel producing states must rapidly scale up their provision of adequate, predictable, new and additional financing, primarily in the form of grants, not loans, for affected individuals and communities, particularly in lower income states, to access the support needed to address existing and future climate change induced loss and damage.","{'https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/themes/humanity-theme/assets/images/icon-twitter.svg', 'https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/themes/humanity-theme/assets/images/icon-facebook.svg', 'https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-2041975320-1024x683.jpg', 'https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/129327069-45f0fe5f-7fa9-4b09-acbb-3272541534ab-170x72.png', 'https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-2041975320-1468x710.jpg', 'https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/amnesty-international-logomark.jpg'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbW5lc3R5Lm9yZy9lbi9sYXRlc3QvbmV3cy8yMDI0LzAzL3Bha2lzdGFuLWV4dHJlbWUtd2VhdGhlci1ldmVudHMtZXhlbXBsaWZ5LXRoZS11cmdlbnQtbmVlZC10by1vcGVyYXRpb25hbGl6ZS10aGUtbG9zcy1hbmQtZGFtYWdlLWZ1bmQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1
Pakistan gears up for another Afghan eviction after Eid,[],"As tensions between Islamabad and Kabul worsened over security last year, almost half a million Afghans left Pakistan after the former administration ordered unauthorized migrants to leave or face imprisonment

Pakistan is reportedly compiling information on Afghan migrants, including those who are legally residing there, in front of a new round of evictions that is scheduled to begin after Eid.

As tensions between Islamabad and Kabul worsened over security last year, almost half a million Afghans left Pakistan after the former administration ordered unauthorized migrants to leave or face imprisonment.

Islamabad had originally set a deadline of November 2023, but two officials—who wished to remain anonymous—stated that evictions would start up again in the upcoming weeks.

“This time, instructions have been given to also collect data and conduct mapping of legally resident Afghan citizens,” said a top government official in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, bordering Afghanistan.

Although “a final decision” has not yet been made by the government, according to a top Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police official, “police have sprung into action regarding Afghan citizens.”

“The federal government has directed to not only collect data of legal and illegal Afghan citizens but also to conduct their mapping,” he said.

Two officials, who wished to remain anonymous, previously told news agency AFP that there will be a fresh effort to remove migrants following Eid, which is scheduled for the second week of April and marks the conclusion of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.

Islamabad has previously stated that its faltering economy and security reasons justify the enormous eviction operation.

However, experts claim it is intended to put pressure on Kabul regarding the escalating attacks in Pakistan’s border areas with Afghanistan, where the Taliban regime is charged of providing safe harbor and support to extremists.

The claims have been repeatedly refuted by the Taliban administration.

Over the years, millions of Afghans have fled decades of spiraling conflict and flowed into Pakistan.

Afghans who departed Pakistan last year were only permitted to bring a certain amount of cash and personal items across the border, and they did so in the middle of one of the greatest humanitarian catastrophes in history.

Some were born in Pakistan to Afghan parents and had never before set foot in Afghanistan.

Since the Taliban regime took over in August 2021 and enforced its strict version of Islamic law, an estimated 600,000 people have arrived.

Pakistan reported that there were 1.7 million Afghans residing in the country illegally prior to the start of the first wave of evictions.

Eight people were killed last week in Pakistani airstrikes in Afghanistan’s border regions, according to Taliban sources, exacerbating the standoff between Islamabad and Kabul.

President Asif Ali Zardari attributed the killing of seven Pakistani troops on Pakistani soil to militants, outside forces, and threatened retaliation. This led to Pakistan’s attack on Afghanistan.

US Diplomat Denies Pushing Pakistani PM Khan Out of Office,['Sarah Zaman'],"A top U.S. diplomat for South and Central Asia has for the first time publicly addressed allegations of conspiring to oust Pakistan's then-Prime Minister Imran Khan in 2022.



Testifying before the House Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Donald Lu rejected the charge that he or his government played a role in fomenting Khan's ouster.



""These allegations, this conspiracy theory, is a lie, it is a complete falsehood,"" Lu said responding to a question by committee Chairman Representative Joe Wilson, a Republican from the U.S. state of South Carolina.



Cypher conspiracy



In April 2022, Khan was expelled from power in a parliamentary vote of no-confidence.



Khan has since alleged that a secret diplomatic cable, or cypher, sent by then-Pakistani ambassador to the U.S. Asad Majeed Khan, proves the United States conspired with Pakistan's military and opposition leaders to remove him from office. The cable described a March 7, 2022, meeting with Lu in Washington.



Last August, an American news outlet, The Intercept, published what it said was the text of the cipher.



According to Ambassador Khan's purported cable, the State Department officials at the meeting encouraged Khan to tell Pakistan's powerful military that Islamabad could expect warmer relations if Khan were removed from office because of his neutrality on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Pakistani prime minister was in Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the day the invasion began and failed to condemn it.

""I think if the no-confidence vote against the Prime Minister succeeds, all will be forgiven in Washington because the Russia visit is being looked at as a decision by the Prime Minister. … Otherwise, I think it will be tough going ahead,"" the document quoted Lu as telling the Pakistani ambassador.



While the State Department has consistently rejected the allegation of conspiring in Khan's ouster, the department's spokesperson Mathew Miller conceded last year that the Biden administration was unhappy with Khan's overtures to Russia.



""We expressed concern privately to the government of Pakistan as we expressed concerns publicly about the visit of then-Prime Minister Khan to Moscow on the very day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. We made that concern quite clear,"" Miller said at a regular press conference while responding to a question about The Intercept's reporting.



The Pakistani military and Khan's opponents also have rejected his allegations.



The former Pakistani prime minister is currently serving a 10-year prison term for revealing the contents of the secret cable, a charge he rejects as politically motivated.



Lu called the reporting of the diplomatic cable in Pakistani media inaccurate.



""At no point does it [the cypher] accuse the United States' government or me personally of taking steps against Imran Khan,"" he told the committee.



Lu pointed out that Pakistan's now-former ambassador Khan had also testified to his government that there was no U.S. conspiracy to remove the prime minister from office.



In March 2022, Pakistan's National Security Committee headed by Khan issued a demarche to the U.S ambassador over his country's ""interference"" in Pakistan's politics.



After Khan's ouster, however, another NSC committee headed by then-Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif concluded that the diplomatic cable did not indicate any U.S. conspiracy.



""We respect the sovereignty of Pakistan. We respect the principle that Pakistani people should be the only ones choosing their own leaders through a democratic process,"" Lu told Wednesday's hearing.

The assistant secretary was disrupted several times as some in the audience called him a liar. The proceedings stopped on a few occasions, and Capital Police removed some in attendance for being disruptive.



Lu told the committee that he has received several death threats, and his family also has been threatened over ""unfounded allegations"" since Khan's removal.



Election irregularities



Addressing reports of irregularities in Pakistan's February 8 general elections, Lu said the Biden administration was persistently urging Pakistani authorities to investigate.



""We as a partner of Pakistan have called for that to be done transparently and fully and for those found responsible for irregularities to be held accountable.""



Pakistan's much-delayed elections faced several controversies. A state-backed crackdown on Khan's party, pre-election violence including terror attacks, suspension of mobile internet services on Election Day, and a massive delay in announcing results led local and international observers to question the fairness of the vote.



The United States, U.K. and the EU have called on Pakistan to probe the discrepancies.



In a February 28 letter to President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, a bipartisan group of 31 members of the U.S. Congress urged the administration not to recognize Pakistan's new government until ""a thorough, transparent, and credible investigation of election interference"" was conducted.



In a statement on April 13, though, Blinken congratulated Sharif on being elected as prime minister of Pakistan. U.S. ambassador to Islamabad Donald Blome has since met Pakistan's new president, prime minister, as well as foreign and finance ministers.



Representative Greg Casar, a Democrat from Texas who was among the authors of the letter, questioned Lu on the administration recognizing Sharif's government.



""We do not go around recognizing or withholding recognition. We decide whether we are going to engage with the government,"" said Lu.



Pakistan's polls delivered a hung parliament. Khan's party had to field candidates as independents after it was deprived of a unified elections symbol.



Although candidates backed by Khan's PTI won the largest number of seats in the lower house of the parliament, Sharif's party, which came in second, formed a coalition government with Khan's opponents.","{'https://gdb.voanews.com/9C43F3B4-D1CA-461C-92A5-236B422D6C19.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-c0a8-0242-fe7a-08dc4212cd60_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/3b8f7121-77be-400f-9e2b-7535cc04fe6a_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0a00-0242-f554-08dc37b37b59_cx0_cy1_cw0_w250_r1_s.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-1129-08dc4dbc1c20_w160_r1.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/Content/responsive/VOA/en-US/img/logo.svg', 'https://news.google.com/Content/responsive/VOA/en-US/img/logo-compact.svg', 'https://news.google.com/Content/responsive/VOA/en-US/img/logo-print_color.png', 'https://news.google.com/Content/responsive/img/player-spinner.png', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-970e-08dc42a6c2ba_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-f333-08dc4d199c6a_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-a614-08dc4d99b9c9_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/Content/responsive/VOA/en-US/img/logo-print.gif', 'https://bbg.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/b/ss/bbgrvoaenglish-bbgprod-bbgentityvoa-bbgunitvoaenglish/1/G.4--NS/991314773?pageName=voa%3aeng%3ar%3aarticle%3aus%20diplomat%20denies%20pushing%20pakistani%20pm%20khan%20out%20of%20office&c6=us%20diplomat%20denies%20pushing%20pakistani%20pm%20khan%20out%20of%20office&pangea_version=8.30.0.0.275&v6=D=c6&g=https%3a%2f%2fwww.voanews.com&c1=D=g&v1=D=g&events=event1&c7=us%20diplomat%20denies%20pushing%20pakistani%20pm%20khan%20out%20of%20office&v7=D=c7&c16=voa%20english&v16=D=c16&c5=s_south-central-asia&v5=D=c5&ch=english&v15=D=ch&c15=D=ch&c4=article&v4=D=c4&c14=7535968&v14=D=c14&c20=no&c17=responsive&v17=D=c17'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvdXMtZGlwbG9tYXQtZGVuaWVzLXB1c2hpbmctcGFraXN0YW5pLXBtLWtoYW4tb3V0LW9mLW9mZmljZS83NTM1OTY4Lmh0bWzSAWNodHRwczovL3d3dy52b2FuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvdXMtZGlwbG9tYXQtZGVuaWVzLXB1c2hpbmctcGFraXN0YW5pLXBtLWtoYW4tb3V0LW9mLW9mZmljZS83NTM1OTY4Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1
Attack in Pakistan's Gwadar strikes near heart of China's interests,[],"ISLAMABAD -- A militant attack near the southwestern Pakistani port of Gwadar has reignited security concerns surrounding China's Belt and Road projects in the country, challenging the new government in Islamabad and undermining assurances to Beijing.

Eight militants stormed the Gwadar Port Authority complex on Wednesday, 7 kilometers from the port itself and operated by China Overseas Ports Holding as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). They crashed a car full of explosives into the gate of the complex, but it did not fully detonate.

Pakistan Airlines Extends Gain to 600% on Privatization Progress,['Faseeh Mangi'],"Shares of Pakistan International Airlines rallied to a record as the government’s bid to sell the state-owned carrier made progress.

The stock jumped 7.5% on Thursday, taking its advance since August Bloomberg Terminal last year — when the government decided to privatize the loss-making airline — to about 607%. The latest catalyst came as the cabinet approved a plan to turn Bloomberg Terminal the carrier into a holding company to speed up its privatization.","{'https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ibRAwJ1xeqyE/v1/-1x-1.jpg', 'https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ibRAwJ1xeqyE/v1/1200x900.jpg'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDI0LTAzLTIxL3Bha2lzdGFuLWFpcmxpbmVzLWV4dGVuZHMtZ2Fpbi10by02MDAtb24tcHJpdmF0aXphdGlvbi1wcm9ncmVzc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1
Baloch militants attack Pakistan naval air base in Balochistan; bid foiled and six terrorists killed,['Authors'],"March 26, 2024 11:40 am | Updated 05:07 pm IST - Karachi

Armed Baloch militants tried to infiltrate one of the main naval air bases in Pakistan’s restive Balochistan province, but security forces foiled the attack and killed all four terrorists. The attack on March 25 night took place in Turbat, a turbulent district in the sparsely populated province.

Makran Commissioner Saeed Ahmed Umrani told the media that security forces had foiled an armed terrorist attack at the PNS Siddique Naval Air Base which is among the biggest naval air stations in the country. “The armed men attacked from three sides of the airport boundary, but security forces responded immediately and foiled their attempt to infiltrate the premises,” he said.

Eyewitnesses reported they had heard gunfire and explosions throughout the night.

According to a statement by the army, terrorists on the night of March 25-26 attempted to attack Pakistan Naval Base, PNS Siddique in the Turbat area of Balochistan province. However, it was thwarted due to the swift and effective response by the troops ensuring the safety and security of personnel and assets. “Security forces in the vicinity were immediately mobilized to support the naval troops. Synergetic and effective response by the armed forces enabled the killing of all four terrorists in ensuing joint clearance operation,” the army said.

During an intense fire exchange, a 24-year-old Sepoy of the paramilitary Frontier Corps Balochistan was killed.

A security official said on condition of anonymity that terrorists were unable to cause any damage at the airbase or to aeroplanes. No loss of sensitive naval installations was reported, the official said.

A sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area and Pakistan Armed Forces were committed to eliminating the menace of terrorism from the country at all costs.

The banned Balochistan Liberation Army claimed that its Majeed Brigade was behind the attack.

This is the third major attack on security forces and installations this year in Balochistan claimed by the BLA with the first two attacks being also being repulsed by security forces.

Earlier in the year, security forces were attacked in Mach town in which at least ten people were killed but attempts to breach the Mach jail were thwarted by security forces.

On March 24, the BLA also claimed responsibility for an attack on the Gwadar Port Authority Complex. Security forces had killed eight militants of the banned separatist group in the gunfire.

Insurgency in Balochistan

Balochistan, bordering Iran and Afghanistan, is home to a long-running violent insurgency. Baloch insurgent groups have previously carried out several attacks targeting the $60 billion CPEC projects. The BLA accuses China and Islamabad of exploitation of the resource-rich province, a charge rejected by the authorities.

BLA’s Majeed Brigade, which was formed in 2011, is a particularly lethal guerilla cell of the BLA.

It has been alleged that the group also maintains sanctuaries in areas along the Pakistan-Iran border.

The brigade, which is the suicide squad of the BLA, mostly targets security forces and Chinese interests in Pakistan. It had also claimed responsibility for the April 2022 suicide attack outside the Karachi University’s Confucius Institute.","{'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/more-search.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/search-gray-icon.svg', 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=123456&cs_ucfr=1&cv=2.0&cj=1', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/thehindu-logo.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/account-btn-icon-black.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/google-signin/group-12945.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/myaccount-gift-black-icon.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/share-page-icon.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/h-circle-black-white-new.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/menu-hamber-icon.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/close-image-icon.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/open-app-arrow.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/google-signin/th-online-icon.svg', 'https://th-i.thgim.com/public/news/national/yl0bte/article67993369.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/vbk-turbat%20pakistan.jpg'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdS5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL2JhbG9jaC1taWxpdGFudHMtYXR0YWNrLXBha2lzdGFuLW5hdmFsLWFpci1iYXNlLWluLWJhbG9jaGlzdGFuLWJpZC1mb2lsZWQtYW5kLXNpeC10ZXJyb3Jpc3RzLWtpbGxlZC9hcnRpY2xlNjc5OTMzMzAuZWNl0gGoAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9uZXdzL2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvYmFsb2NoLW1pbGl0YW50cy1hdHRhY2stcGFraXN0YW4tbmF2YWwtYWlyLWJhc2UtaW4tYmFsb2NoaXN0YW4tYmlkLWZvaWxlZC1hbmQtc2l4LXRlcnJvcmlzdHMta2lsbGVkL2FydGljbGU2Nzk5MzMzMC5lY2UvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1

With this new agreement, the ICC is close to concluding its media rights sales process for its next commercial cycle in cricket's various key markets.

Deals in the UK (Sky), the US (Willow TV), India (Star Sports), Australia (Amazon Prime), the Middle East and North Africa (Evision), and sub-Saharan Africa (SuperSport), have all been unveiled, with now only New Zealand and the rest of South Asia (Bangladesh and Sri Lanka) remaining as the outliers where a deal has not yet been announced.

Earlier this month, sports broadcasting heavyweight ESPN renewed its rights deal with the ICC covering both men’s and women’s major events through 2031.

Meanwhile, the ICC last week launched a tender in key territories for audio rights to its major events through 2027.","{'https://www.sportcal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2024/03/main65fdb25392593.png', 'https://news.google.com/code/wp-content/themes/goodlife-wp-B2B/assets/img/icons/facebook_icon_w.svg', 'https://www.sportcal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2024/03/main65fdb2420ce7d.jpg', 'https://www.sportcal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2022/12/Sportcal_footer.png', 'https://pr-fr-json-b2b-gdm-figaro1.pantheonsite.io/pharmaceutical-technology/wp-content/themes/goodlife-wp-B2B/assets/img/report.png', 'https://www.sportcal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2022/12/S.png', 'https://news.google.com/wp-content/themes/goodlife-wp-B2B/assets/images/icons/catfish-icon.svg', 'https://news.google.com/code/wp-content/themes/goodlife-wp-B2B/assets/images/verdict-logo-w.png', 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==', 'https://news.google.com/code/wp-content/themes/goodlife-wp-B2B/assets/img/icons/twitter_icon_w.svg', 'https://news.google.com/code/wp-content/themes/goodlife-wp-B2B/assets/img/icons/linkedin_icon_w.svg', 'https://www.sportcal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2024/03/main6602ef330a198.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/wp-content/themes/goodlife-wp-B2B/assets/images/newsletter-new.svg', 'https://www.sportcal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2024/03/main6602ee252b181.jpg'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0Y2FsLmNvbS9tZWRpYS9wdHYtdG93ZXItc3BvcnRzLWxhbmQtaWNjLXJpZ2h0cy1pbi1wYWtpc3Rhbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1
Five Chinese Citizens Killed In Suicide Bomb Attack In Pakistan,['About The Author'],"Five Chinese citizens were killed on Tuesday when a suicide bomber targeted their vehicle in northwest Pakistan, news agency AFP said. “Five Chinese and their local driver were killed in the attack,” Muhammad Ali Gandapur, a senior police official in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, was quoted as saying by the news agency.

A total of six people, including the driver, have died in the terror attack.

The suicide bomber rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a convoy of engineers, according to a report by news agency Reuters.

The engineers, mostly foreign nationals, were travelling from a hydroelectric dam construction site towards the capital Islamabad when the bombing happened near Besham city.

Chinese citizens are often targeted by militants in Pakistan, where Beijing has huge investments under its “Belt and Road” initiative which has seen it ink two $2 trillion in contracts around the world.

In 2021 a bus carrying engineers to a construction site near a dam in northwest Pakistan was hit by a bomb, killing 13 people including nine Chinese workers.","{'https://images.news18.com/static_news18/pix/ibnhome/news18/app_icon.svg?impolicy=website&width=12&height=15', 'https://images.news18.com/static_news18/ibnlive/pix/NewIcon.svg',

"Five Chinese dam workers, driver killed in attack in northwest Pakistan; China condemns attack",['Authors'],"March 26, 2024 07:00 pm | Updated 08:14 pm IST - Peshawar, Pakistan

Five Chinese nationals working on a major dam construction site were killed along with their driver on March 26 when a suicide bomber targeted their vehicle in northwest Pakistan, officials said.

Their vehicle plunged into a deep ravine off the mountainous Karakoram Highway after the bomber rammed his car into them and detonated his explosives, police said.

Beijing has poured billions of dollars into Pakistan in recent years, but Chinese-funded projects have sparked resentment and their citizens have frequently come under attack.

Images shared with AFP show smoke rising from the valley, near Besham city in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

""Five Chinese and their local driver were killed in the attack,"" Muhammad Ali Gandapur, a senior provincial police official, told AFP.

He said the vehicle was travelling between the Dasu hydroelectric dam site, under construction by the China Gezhouba Group Company, and the capital Islamabad.

Zahid Khan, a senior local police official, told AFP that ""a suicide bomber crashed his vehicle into theirs"".

""The vehicle caught fire and plunged down the ravine,"" he said.

In 2021, a bus carrying engineers to the same construction site was hit by a bomb, killing 13 people including nine Chinese workers.

The attack on March 26 comes days after security forces killed at least seven militants as they attempted to storm the offices of Gwadar Port in southwest Pakistan, considered a cornerstone of Chinese investment.

Militants also killed one soldier as they attempted to storm a major naval air base in the country's southwest, Pakistan's military said on March 26.

""Strategic projects and sensitive sites vital for Pakistan's economic progress and the well-being of its people are being targeted as a conscious effort to retard our progress and slow discord between Pakistan and its strategic allies and partners, most notably China,"" the Army said.

The Chinese embassy in Islamabad described the bombing as a ""terrorist act"" in a statement reported by Chinese state media.

""The Chinese embassy and consulates in Pakistan strongly condemn this terrorist act, and express deep condolences for the victims of both countries and extend sincere sympathies to the families of the victims,"" the embassy said.

'Plotted to disrupt'

Beijing is Islamabad's closest regional ally, readily providing financial assistance to bail out its often struggling neighbour.

The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has seen tens of billions of dollars funnelled into massive transport, energy and infrastructure projects — part of Beijing's transnational ""Belt and Road"" scheme.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and as well as Pakistan's Interior and Foreign Ministers arrived at China's embassy in Islamabad within hours of the bombing.

""Once again, the adversaries of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) have plotted to disrupt it through such cowardly acts,"" Mr. Sharif said in a statement.

""However, they will never succeed in their malevolent ambitions.""

Separatist groups say locals see little benefit from major Chinese projects, with most jobs going to outsiders.

The security of Chinese workers has long been of concern to both countries.

""The Chinese workers were already scared and feared that another attack was coming,"" said Azeem Khalid, a Chinese investment expert at COMSATS University Islamabad.

""With every such incident, the speed of the project will be slower.""

In 2019, gunmen stormed a luxury hotel in Balochistan province overlooking the flagship Chinese-backed deep-water seaport in Gwadar that gives strategic access to the Arabian Sea — killing at least eight people.

In June 2020, Baloch insurgents targeted the Pakistan Stock Exchange, which is partly owned by Chinese companies, in the commercial capital of Karachi.

China ‘strongly condemns terrorist act’

China on March 26 said it strongly condemned the attack.

“The Chinese embassy and consulates in Pakistan strongly condemn this terrorist act, and express deep condolences for the victims of both countries and extend sincere sympathies to the families of the victims,” the embassy said in a statement.","{'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/more-search.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/search-gray-icon.svg', 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=123456&cs_ucfr=1&cv=2.0&cj=1', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/thehindu-logo.svg', 'https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/ozmqa1/article67994573.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/AFP_34M92PM.jpg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/account-btn-icon-black.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/google-signin/group-12945.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/myaccount-gift-black-icon.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/share-page-icon.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/h-circle-black-white-new.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/menu-hamber-icon.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/close-image-icon.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/open-app-arrow.svg', 'https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/google-signin/th-online-icon.svg'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdS5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL2ZpdmUtY2hpbmVzZS1kYW0td29ya2Vycy1kcml2ZXIta2lsbGVkLWluLWF0dGFjay1pbi1ub3J0aHdlc3QtcGFraXN0YW4tY2hpbmEtY29uZGVtbnMtYXR0YWNrL2FydGljbGU2Nzk5NDU2MS5lY2XSAaEBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaGluZHUuY29tL25ld3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9maXZlLWNoaW5lc2UtZGFtLXdvcmtlcnMtZHJpdmVyLWtpbGxlZC1pbi1hdHRhY2staW4tbm9ydGh3ZXN0LXBha2lzdGFuLWNoaW5hLWNvbmRlbW5zLWF0dGFjay9hcnRpY2xlNjc5OTQ1NjEuZWNlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1

Armed Baloch militants made attempts to infiltrate one of the main naval air bases in Pakistan 's Balochistan , reports said on March 26. Security forces thwarted the attack and killed at least six terrorists.The attack occurred on Monday night took place in Turbat, a restive district, news agency PTI reported.The armed attack took place at the PNS Siddique Naval Air Base. The assault was attempted from three sides of the airport boundary. Witnesses reported hearing gunfire and explosions overnight. Any harm on the airbase or aircraft was averted, securitymen said.The banned Balochistan Liberation Army 's Majeed Brigade claimed responsibility for the assault. This is the third assault on security forces and installations this year claimed by the BLA.The BLA had previously attempted two attacks that were also repelled by security forces. In a prior incident in Mach town, at least ten individuals lost their lives in an assault on security forces, although the attempt to breach the Mach jail was thwarted.On March 24, the BLA took responsibility for an assault on the Gwadar Port Authority Complex, resulting in the killing of eight militants.Balochistan, situated near Iran and Afghanistan, has been plagued by a prolonged violent insurgency. Various Baloch insurgent factions have targeted the high-value CPEC projects, accusing China and Islamabad of exploiting the province's resources -- a claim authorities refute.The BLA's Majeed Brigade, established in 2011, is a highly effective guerilla unit known for targeting security forces and Chinese interests. The group reportedly operates sanctuaries along the Pak-Iran border. The brigade, viewed as the BLA's suicide squad, was also behind the April 2022 suicide attack near the Karachi University's Confucius Institute.","{'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-108710820,imgsize-21294,width-138,height-104,quality-100/prime/money-and-markets/toyota-hitachi-return-around-100-in-one-year-is-japan-finally-out-of-the-woods.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-108766291,imgsize-132764,width-138,height-104,quality-100/markets/stocks/news/stock-picks-of-the-week-5-stocks-with-consistent-score-improvement-and-upside-potential-of-up-to-44.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/photo/42031747.cms', 'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/thumb/width-152,height-114,resizemode-75,imgsize-425840,msid-108795481/pm-dials-sandeshkhali-survivor-rekha-patra.jpg', 'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/thumb/width-152,height-114,resizemode-75,imgsize-22584,msid-108794856/bharti-hexacom-ipo-to-open-on-april-3.jpg', 'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/thumb/width-152,height-114,resizemode-75,imgsize-26480,msid-108791060/idf-uncovers-weapons-cache-in-al-shifa-hospital.jpg', 'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/thumb/width-152,height-114,resizemode-75,imgsize-44018,msid-108786765/punjab-bjp-to-go-solo-in-all-13-lok-sabha-seats.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-108778124,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-7922,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-81633715,quality-100/et-prime-logo.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-108767869,imgsize-24188,width-138,height-104,quality-100/prime/technology-and-startups/pay-for-offer-how-it-freshers-can-protect-themselves-from-hiring-scams.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/photo/104857408.cms', 'https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-74462387,quality-100/et-logo.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-108771638,imgsize-116994,width-138,height-104,quality-100/prime/economy-and-policy/wont-be-surprised-if-3pl-accounts-for-half-of-total-warehouse-leasing-in-future-allcargo-executive.jpg', 'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/thumb/width-152,height-114,resizemode-75,imgsize-481909,msid-108796436/uks-lord-cameron-sanctions-china-for-cyber-attacks.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-76920425,quality-100/et-logo.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/photo/47865640.cms', 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-108754169,imgsize-82502,width-138,height-104,quality-100/markets/stocks/news/stock-radar-srf-breaks-above-downward-sloping-trendline-on-weekly-charts-time-to-buy.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-78187515,quality-100/cross.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/photo/94935185.cms', 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-108784436,width-300,height-225,imgsize-573158,resizemode-75/.jpg', 'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/thumb/width-152,height-114,resizemode-75,imgsize-32240,msid-108787892/india-firmly-supports-philippines-says-eam-jaishankar.jpg', 'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/thumb/width-152,height-114,resizemode-75,imgsize-34772,msid-108797180/sonam-wangchuk-ends-21-day-fast-over-ladakh.jpg', 'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/thumb/width-152,height-114,resizemode-75,imgsize-26020,msid-108797242/territorial-dispute-india-vs-china.jpg', 'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/thumb/width-152,height-114,resizemode-75,imgsize-27818,msid-108790797/i-will-come-out-clean-brs-leader-k-kavitha.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-108771434,imgsize-24082,width-138,height-104,quality-100/prime/money-and-markets/sbis-parabolic-rally-has-seen-mfs-book-profits-will-investors-continue-to-bet-on-kharas-optimism.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-74451948,quality-100/et-logo.jpg', 'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/thumb/width-152,height-114,resizemode-75,imgsize-63956,msid-108793670/pakistan-suicide-bombing-claims-lives-of-five-chinese.jpg'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL3dvcmxkLW5ld3MvcGFraXN0YW4tc2Vjb25kLWxhcmdlc3QtbmF2YWwtYWlyLXN0YXRpb24tcG5zLXNpZGRpcXVlLWluLXR1cmJhdC11bmRlci1hdHRhY2svYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvMTA4Nzc4MDg1LmNtc9IBpQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL3dvcmxkLW5ld3MvcGFraXN0YW4tc2Vjb25kLWxhcmdlc3QtbmF2YWwtYWlyLXN0YXRpb24tcG5zLXNpZGRpcXVlLWluLXR1cmJhdC11bmRlci1hdHRhY2svYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzEwODc3ODA4NS5jbXM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1
Pakistan: New Government Should Protect Rights,[],"Click to expand Image Shehbaz Sharif was sworn in as Pakistan’s prime minister on March 4, 2024, after lawmakers in the National Assembly elected him for the second time. © 2024 K.M. Chaudary

(New York) – Pakistan’s newly elected prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, should make human rights a key focus of his government, Human Rights Watch said in a letter today to the prime minister. The new Pakistani government should adopt an agenda that actively promotes and protects human rights, advances the rule of law, and strengthens democratic institutions.

“Pakistani Prime Minister Sharif’s new government faces many challenges that need to be addressed by upholding human rights,” said Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The government should begin by reversing abusive laws and policies and demonstrating a genuine commitment to the rule of law and equal justice.”

As Pakistan faces one of the worst economic crises in its history, the government has an obligation to ensure adequate social security to uphold the rights of Pakistanis to health, food, social security, and an adequate standard of living.

Human Rights Watch urged the Pakistani government to take concrete steps to protect fundamental civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights in nine key areas. These are economic justice; electoral reforms; digital rights; freedom of expression and protecting civil society; freedom of religion and belief; prison reform; ending violence against women and girls; improving access to education; and protecting rights in counterterrorism operations.","{'https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2024/03/202403asia_pakistan_sharif.jpg?h=5bb61d7a&itok=Ie7Ikp1j', 'https://news.google.com/sites/default/files/styles/square/public/media_2022/06/202206us_wrd_abortionprotest.jpg?h=790be497&itok=fB4yrifY', 'https://news.google.com/sites/default/files/styles/square/public/media_2024/02/202403asia_malaysia_kualalumpur_migrantdetention.JPG?h=fbf14fce&itok=rOXVXNBR', 'https://news.google.com/sites/default/files/styles/square/public/multimedia_images_2019/201911env_drc_main.jpg?itok=0ncQBsJZ', 'https://news.google.com/sites/default/files/styles/square/public/multimedia_images_2017/201712eca_russia_stpetersburgmourners.jpg?itok=dje0lkI1', 'https://news.google.com/sites/default/files/styles/embed_xxl/public/media_2024/03/202403asia_pakistan_sharif.jpg?itok=GvAm6vem', 'https://news.google.com/sites/default/files/styles/square/public/media_2021/04/202104mena_israelpalestine_barrier.jpg?h=8fd0f494&itok=-AudwxNw', 'https://news.google.com/sites/default/files/styles/square/public/media_2024/01/202312asia_pakistan_wr.jpg?h=30e01b64&itok=vu7rnA3W', 'https://news.google.com/themes/custom/hrw_design/dist/app-drupal/assets/loading.svg', 'https://news.google.com/sites/default/files/styles/square/public/media_2024/03/202403asia_nepal_PabitraSunakhari.jpg?h=5ec6b7b8&itok=GkEyPi5b', 'https://news.google.com/sites/default/files/styles/square/public/media_2024/02/202402asia_pakistan_protester.jpg?h=deaec4b9&itok=ETtyb4WS', 'https://news.google.com/sites/default/files/styles/square/public/media_2022/10/202210asia_india_bulldozer.JPG?h=278c4d67&itok=C7NuQDEE'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhydy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDI0LzAzLzExL3Bha2lzdGFuLW5ldy1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LXNob3VsZC1wcm90ZWN0LXJpZ2h0c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1
Pakistani airstrikes target suspected Pakistani Taliban hideouts in Afghanistan,[],"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistani airstrikes targeted multiple suspected hideouts of the Pakistani Taliban inside neighboring Afghanistan early on Monday, the foreign ministry said. The Afghan Taliban said the attacks killed at least eight people and prompted return fire from their forces.

The exchange, two days after seven Pakistani soldiers were killed in a suicide bombing and coordinated attack in the country’s northwest, marked an escalation that is likely to further increase tensions between Islamabad and Kabul.

The Foreign Office in Islamabad confirmed the strikes, describing them as “intelligence-based anti-terrorist operations in the border regions inside Afghanistan” and saying they targeted a splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban.

The Afghan Taliban denounced the strikes as an aggression on Afghanistan’s territorial integrity, and said later Monday their forces “targeted Pakistan’s military centers along the border with heavy weapons,” without providing details.

Earlier in the day, two Pakistani security and intelligence officials told The Associated Press the strikes were carried out in Khost and Paktika provinces bordering Pakistan. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to reporters.

It was not immediately clear how deep inside Afghanistan the Pakistani jets flew for Monday’s strikes — the first since 2022, when Pakistan targeted militant hideouts in Afghanistan. Islamabad never officially confirmed those strikes.

AP AUDIO: Pakistani jets target suspected Pakistani Taliban hideouts in Afghanistan, killing 8 people. AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma has more.

Chief Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said three women and three children were killed in the airstrikes the district of Barmal in Paktika while two other women were killed in a strike in Khost.

“Such attacks are a violation of Afghanistan’s sovereignty and there will be bad consequences,” Mujahid said.

According to the two Pakistani officials, mortars fired by the Afghan Taliban in Monday’s return fire wounded four people and forced some villagers in the Kurram district to move to safer areas. Pakistani troops fired back, the officials said.

On Saturday, a suicide bomber rammed his explosive-laden truck into a military post in the Pakistani town of Mir Ali, a town in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province that borders Afghanistan, killing seven Pakistani soldiers. Troops responded and killed all six attackers in a shootout, the military said.

Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari attended the soldiers’ funerals and vowed to retaliate, saying “the blood of our martyred soldiers will not go in vain.”

A newly formed militant group, Jaish-e-Fursan-e-Muhammad claimed the Mir Ali attack. Pakistani officials believe the group is mainly made up of members of the Pakistani Taliban, the outlawed Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP, which often targets Pakistani soldiers and police.

Muhammad Ali, an Islamabad based security expert, said army Lt. Col. Kashif Ali and Cpt. Ahmad Badar were among those killed in Mir Ali and that Monday’s airstrikes were an obvious retaliation, coming within 24 hours of Zardari’s warning.

“Pakistan’s patience for the Afghan interim government’s continued hospitality for terrorists conducting frequent attacks on Pakistan from inside Afghanistan has finally run out,” Ali said.

Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the families of the lieutenant colonel and the captain slain in Mir Ali and paid tribute to all the soldiers killed in the attack. He did not comment on the airstrikes in Afghanistan.

Separately, the Pakistani military said security forces carried out an operation Monday in North Waziristan near the Afghan border, killing eight militants linked to Saturday’s attack.

The Afghan Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in 2021 as the U.S. and NATO troops were in the final stages of their pullout after 20 years of war. The Taliban takeover in Afghanistan emboldened the TTP, whose top leaders and fighters are hiding in Afghanistan.

The Afghan Taliban insist they do not allow the Pakistani Taliban — or any other militant group — to use Afghanistan’s soil to launch attacks. However, the TTP has stepped up attacks inside Pakistan in recent years, straining relations between Kabul and Islamabad.

Adding to the tensions between the two countries was a move by Islamabad last year to expel Afghans living in Pakistan without valid documents. Pakistan has long hosted about 1.7 million Afghans, most of whom fled during the 1979-1989 Soviet occupation of their country. More than half a million fled Afghanistan when the Taliban seized power.

So far, Pakistan has expelled nearly half a million Afghans in the ongoing crackdown. Islamabad says Afghans who have refugee status have not been deported.

The deportations have also drawn criticism from the international community and analysts have warned that mass deportations risk radicalizing those who have been forced out of Pakistan — often returning to deplorable conditions back in Afghanistan.

In January, Pakistani strikes — in a tit-for-tat exchanges with Tehran — hit Pakistani militants inside Iran, briefly raising tensions but the two neighbors. The situation calmed after Tehran and Islamabad agreed to cooperate against each other’s militants.

"We Don't Want Armed Conflict With Afghanistan, Pakistani Defense Minister Tells VOA",['Sarah Zaman'],"Pakistan’s Defense Minister Khawaja Asif says his country does not want to engage in an armed conflict with neighbor Afghanistan after Islamabad conducted airstrikes this week on alleged terrorist hideouts across the border.

“Force is the last resort. We do not want to have an armed conflict with Afghanistan,” Asif said, speaking exclusively to VOA.

However, he warned that Islamabad could block the corridor it provides to landlocked Afghanistan for trade with India, saying Pakistan has the right to stop facilitating Kabul if it fails to curb anti-Pakistan terrorists operating on Afghan soil.

“If Afghanistan treats us like an enemy, then why should we give them a trade corridor?” he said.

On Monday, Pakistan confirmed carrying out “intelligence-based anti-terrorist” operations along the border inside Afghanistan targeting banned terrorist outfit Tehrik-e-Taliban and its affiliates.

The strikes came after insurgents killed seven troops, including two officers, in an attack on a regional military base in Pakistan’s border district of North Waziristan on Saturday.

Pakistan alleges that fighters linked to Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, and groups supporting it have a haven in Afghanistan.

Intelligence assessments by the United Nations affirm the TTP presence in Afghanistan and say some ruling Afghan Taliban members have joined its ranks.

“A message needed to be sent that this [cross-border terrorism] has grown too much,” Asif told VOA, adding that Pakistan wanted to convey to the de facto rulers in Kabul “that we cannot continue like this.”

Pakistan has experienced a surge in terror attacks since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in August 2021.

The Afghan Taliban initially brokered talks between Pakistan and TTP, but the latter unilaterally ended a cease-fire in November 2022. Since then, Pakistan has seen a dramatic rise in attacks, primarily against military and security personnel in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces bordering Afghanistan.

An estimated 5,000 to 6,000 TTP fighters are present in Afghanistan. They took refuge across the border after Pakistan conducted massive military operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to flush out terrorists almost a decade ago.

The militant group also provided battlefield support to the Afghan Taliban in their 20-year war against a U.S.-backed government in Kabul.

Asif said that in a visit to Kabul in February 2023, he told Taliban ministers not to let the TTP’s past favors tie Kabul’s hands.

“If they [TTP] have done you a favor and you’re grateful to them, then control them. Don’t let them start a war with us while living in your country, and you become their ally,” he said.

The Taliban denies harboring anti-Pakistan terrorists. Reacting strongly to Monday’s strikes, which Kabul alleged killed eight civilians, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid warned of serious consequences.

“Pakistan should not blame Afghanistan for the lack of control, incompetence and problems in its own territory. Such incidents can have very bad consequences, which will be out of Pakistan's control,” Mujahid said in a statement.

The Taliban Defense Ministry later confirmed that its security forces targeted Pakistani positions with “heavy weapons.""

Since Tuesday, a tense calm has prevailed along the 2,600-kilometer-long border (1,616 miles).

Experts say that while the Taliban do not have the military might to attack Pakistan, the Afghan Taliban could use unconventional means, including actively supporting anti-Pakistan militants, to respond if aggression from Islamabad grows.

“If they can harm us, then we’ll be forced to [retaliate],” Asif said, while expressing hope that Afghanistan would meet the “single demand” of reining in TTP, preventing the need for future military strikes from Pakistan.

The defense minister alleged that Kabul was letting TTP operate against Pakistan in a bid to prevent its members from joining the Islamic State terrorist outfit’s local chapter, known as IS-Khorasan Province. Known commonly as IS-KP, the group is a major internal security threat for Afghanistan.

Reacting to Monday’s strikes, the U.S. State Department urged Pakistan and Afghan Taliban to take steps to address differences.

“We urge the Taliban to ensure that terrorist attacks are not launched from Afghan soil, and we urge Pakistan to exercise restraint and ensure civilians are not harmed in their counterterrorism efforts,” deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told media during a regular press briefing Monday.

Pakistan’s biggest ally, China, has remained silent on the cross-border fighting. Asif dismissed the lack of public support from Beijing.

“It’s not necessary that the world must applaud us. What is in our interest is enough for us. We are protecting our interest, irrespective of whether someone applauds us or not,” Asif said.","{'https://gdb.voanews.com/cea8e744-2bc1-4856-8946-b79f3af366b3_cx0_cy7_cw0_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-f333-08dc4d199c6a_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-1129-08dc4dbc1c20_w160_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-8729-08db154391a0_w250_r1_s.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/Content/responsive/VOA/en-US/img/logo.svg', 'https://news.google.com/Content/responsive/VOA/en-US/img/logo-compact.svg', 'https://news.google.com/Content/responsive/VOA/en-US/img/logo-print_color.png', 'https://news.google.com/Content/responsive/img/player-spinner.png', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-9e2d-08dc1905a6cf_w100_r1.png', 'https://bbg.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/b/ss/bbgrvoaenglish-bbgprod-bbgentityvoa-bbgunitvoaenglish/1/G.4--NS/1705787689?pageName=voa%3aeng%3ar%3aarticle%3awe%20don%27t%20want%20armed%20conflict%20with%20afghanistan%2c%20pakistani%20defense%20minister%20tells%20voa&c6=we%20don%27t%20want%20armed%20conflict%20with%20afghanistan%2c%20pakistani%20defense%20minister%20tells%20voa&pangea_version=8.30.0.0.275&v6=D=c6&g=https%3a%2f%2fwww.voanews.com&c1=D=g&v1=D=g&events=event1&c7=we%20don%27t%20want%20armed%20conflict%20with%20afghanistan%2c%20pakistani%20defense%20minister%20tells%20voa&v7=D=c7&c16=voa%20english&v16=D=c16&c5=s_south-central-asia&v5=D=c5&ch=english&v15=D=ch&c15=D=ch&c4=article&v4=D=c4&c14=7535439&v14=D=c14&c20=no&c17=responsive&v17=D=c17', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-c0a8-0242-f733-08db9216a86a_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/031a0000-0aff-0242-9d36-08da38f8efef_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/6641649d-8921-4190-8c2a-b98cd4071517_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/0a30a157-a538-4956-bbd6-95635e243ee4_cx0_cy5_cw0_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/01000000-0aff-0242-a614-08dc4d99b9c9_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/4F562D31-347A-41BA-8986-D08B36890CBC.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/Content/responsive/VOA/en-US/img/logo-print.gif', 'https://gdb.voanews.com/022a0000-0aff-0242-397f-08dae6bb175d_w100_r1.jpg'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvNzUzNTQzOS5odG1s0gEoaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm9hbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wLzc1MzU0MzkuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1
Pakistan's second-largest naval air base under terrorist attack,[],"Pakistan's second-largest naval air base, PNS Siddique, in Balochistan province's Turbat city has come under an armed terrorist attack. The banned Balochistan Liberation Army's (BLA) Majeed Brigade had claimed responsibility for the attack on the base, where Chinese drones are stationed.

According to The Balochistan Post newspaper, the Majeed Brigade sent a statement to the media, saying that “we have entered the Pakistani Naval Airbase in Turbat”.

It also claimed to have killed “over a dozen” security personnel at the naval base.

Pakistan's Dawn newspaper said the attack on Monday night came after a series of explosions and firing in the city, which, according to local residents, began at about 10 pm and continued for several hours.

A high-ranking official told the newspaper that the attackers ""came from three sides of the airport boundary, but security forces responded immediately and foiled their attempt to infiltrate the premises"".

However, he did not provide any further details, including if there were any casualties or injuries amongst the forces.

Citing security officials, the Dawn newspaper also said that ""six militants were killed outside the Turbat airport boundary, ensuring the safety of the base"".

The officials also said that there were no reports of any loss of ""sensitive naval installations"" at the station, while the Frontier Corps and the navy's special group ""successfully isolated the terrorists"".

The Pakistan Army is yet to make an official statement on the attack.

The Balochistan Post said that this was the BLA's third attack of this year.

On January 29, the separatist group launched an assault in Mach city and on March 20, they attacked the Gwadar port, leading to the deaths of two Pakistani soldiers and eight assailants.

The BLA has been actively seeking independence for Balochistan and has been involved in various violent acts against the state.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's second largest airbase, PNS Siddique on the late hours of Monday came under attack by multiple explosions and gunfire, leaving one paramilitary soldier deal while security forces on the Pakistan side killed all five of the assailants in retaliatory fire.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) has claimed responsibility for the assault on the Naval Airbase in Turbat , citing opposition to Chinese investments in Balochistan's resources.""We escaped a huge loss,"" said a statement from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's office.A Pakistan Navy spokesman said all five attackers were killed after they tried to break into the base.One paramilitary soldier was also killed, said a military statement.The BLA claims that its members have breached the airbase, where Chinese drones are reportedly stationed.In the wake of the incident, an emergency has been declared at Teaching Hospital Turbat by District Health Officer Kech, mandating all doctors to report for duty promptly.This marks the second attack this week and the third this year by BLA's Majeed Brigade. Previously, the group targeted Mach city on January 29 and Military Intelligence's headquarters in Gwadar on March 20.On this occasion, they struck Pakistan's second-largest Naval airbase in Turbat.During the Gwadar incident, two Pakistani soldiers and eight terrorists lost their lives in a clash triggered by explosions and gunfire at the Port Authority Complex.Gwadar port, managed by China, plays a vital role in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which encompasses major infrastructure and energy projects.Recently, there has been an increase in terrorist activities in Pakistan, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, following Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan's termination of its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.The attack represents another significant security challenge in the volatile region, spotlighting the ongoing insurgent activities that threaten major infrastructures and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects.It underscores the persistent unrest in Balochistan, where separatist groups like the BLA have escalated their violent campaigns against Pakistani and Chinese interests.In February, Pakistan witnessed 97 militant incidents, causing 87 deaths and 118 injuries, as reported by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS).This report also emphasizes a significant rise in violent incidents in Balochistan, in contrast to a reduction in the tribal areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) (formerly Fata) and the broader KP region. This increase in violence in Balochistan is linked to the activities of Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF), BRAS, etc., which have been targeting the electoral process and discouraging public participation.Balochistan, a strategic but tumultuous province bordering Iran and Afghanistan, has been marred by a violent insurgency demanding independence from Islamabad. The province is crucial for the CPEC, a multi-billion dollar initiative by China, making it a focal point for attacks. This incident is the latest in a series of assaults targeting security forces and infrastructure in the area.The incident is likely to prompt heightened security measures around key installations in Balochistan and across Pakistan. It may also influence Pakistan's diplomatic relations and security strategies, especially concerning its ties with China and the management of the CPEC projects. The international community, particularly countries invested in the region's stability, will closely monitor the fallout and the Pakistani government's response to the ongoing insurgency threats.","{'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=593671331875494&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108785444,width-400,resizemode-4/108785444.jpg', 'https://static.toiimg.com/photo/83033472.cms', 'https://static.toiimg.com/photo/92222747.cms', 'https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/imgsize-23456,msid-107105857,width-300,resizemode-4/107105857.jpg', 'https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-108782114,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-265366,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg', 'https://static.toiimg.com/photo/87458172.cms'}",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS93b3JsZC9wYWtpc3Rhbi9wYWtpc3Rhbi1zZWNvbmQtbGFyZ2VzdC1uYXZhbC1haXItYmFzZS1hdHRhY2tlZC1iYWxvY2hpc3Rhbi1saWJlcmF0aW9uLWFybXktY2xhaW1zLXJlc3BvbnNpYmlsaXR5L2FydGljbGVzaG93LzEwODc3NDAyNi5jbXPSAbIBaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vd29ybGQvcGFraXN0YW4vcGFraXN0YW4tc2Vjb25kLWxhcmdlc3QtbmF2YWwtYWlyLWJhc2UtYXR0YWNrZWQtYmFsb2NoaXN0YW4tbGliZXJhdGlvbi1hcm15LWNsYWltcy1yZXNwb25zaWJpbGl0eS9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvMTA4Nzc0MDI2LmNtcw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,1
It looks like Pakistan bought a Chinese spy ship. What does it do?,['Usman Ansari'],"ISLAMABAD — It appears Pakistan’s Navy has acquired a Chinese-built spy ship, according to open-source intelligence analyst Damien Symon, who reviewed commercially available satellite imagery.

The intelligence gathering platform, dubbed Rizwan, is described as an “offshore supply ship” by online shipping monitor MarineTraffic. Pakistan reportedly acquired the vessel from China last year with no fanfare, and the ship was spotted during a stopover in Jakarta, Indonesia, in June 2023, while sailing home.

It is a compact vessel some 87.2 meters long, with two large radar domes on the stern, which along with other sensors point to an intelligence gathering role.

Neither the Pakistan Navy nor the Ministry of Defence Production, which handles military acquisitions, would discuss the ship’s role and capabilities when asked by Defense News.

However, a source with knowledge of Rizwan’s operations, speaking on the condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the topic, confirmed to Defense News it is an “information gathering ship.” The source declined to provide further details.

Collin Koh, a senior fellow at the Singapore-based Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies think tank, said Rizwan appears to be an affordable and flexible design.

He told Defense News that the ship is based on the hull of an offshore support vessel, which makes “economical sense,” and that “aside from the huge radome that should serve as the electronic intelligence array, the platform might be able to accept varying mission modules if necessary.”

The ship looks to be dimensionally comparable to Norway’s intelligence gathering vessels Eger and Marjata, Sweden’s Artemis, or Germany’s Oste class, he added.

But Koh doubts Rizwan “has the onboard power capacity for telemetry missile tracking, like those found on the Chinese Yuan Wang series.” Instead, he explained, Rizwan is likely focused on gathering electronic and signals intelligence thanks to “onboard signals processing and analysis capabilities.”

He also said Rizwan’s modular configuration could support mission-specific equipment for hydrographic and oceanographic activities such as undersea gliders that can be launched from the stern deck.

Pakistan probably bought Rizwan in response to recent Indian acquisitions, as the two nations are archrivals, Koh added. And due to the relatively small size of Pakistan’s Navy, a dedicated electronic and signals intelligence platform will reduce the intelligence gathering burden on the service’s aircraft, ships and submarines, he explained.

These platforms would have mainly used electronic sensory measures to capture electromagnetic emissions, but “would have little or no capacity at all to process and analyze the signals,” he said. As a dedicated platform, Rizwan could therefore better monitor Indian naval activity “while freeing up the fleet combat assets for their primary duties.”

Rizwan’s acquisition should be seen in the broader context of Sino-Pakistani relations — specifically Beijing’s support for Pakistan’s military modernization efforts and attempts to keep India occupied in the Indian Ocean rather than beyond that area, said Pakistan analyst Mansoor Ahmed, an academic at Australian National University.

Alongside indigenous development as well as acquisition and production programs with the Dutch and Turkish governments, Chinese help is instrumental in advancing elements of Pakistan’s naval modernization plan. Such support is seen in Pakistan’s Hangor II submarines, long-range unmanned combat drones and anti-ship missiles.

“These and other projects will help plug gaps in fleet air defense, battle management, [electronic warfare], and [intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance] for a potent [anti-access/area denial] capability through three surface task groups operating in the Arabian Sea,” Ahmed said.

They will also transform Pakistan’s Navy into a “regional maritime force and will significantly reduce the overall asymmetry with the Indian Navy,” Ahmed added. It will also help keep India’s Navy “effectively engaged in ways that it will not be able to spare a large part of its assets for deployment beyond the [Indian Ocean region].”

The phoenix that never rises: what’s holding back Pakistan’s economy?,['Ahmed'],"Pakistan’s recent election has further eroded trust between citizens and the state. The economy continues to fall behind its Asian neighbours, with low rates of productivity growth and an unsustainably high burden of external debt. There are no signs these challenges will be addressed any time soon.

Pakistan today is a melting pot of crises. The events leading up to this year’s elections and what followed has only increased the mistrust between the people and the state. Further, the expansion in the role of the military in both politics and the economy – through the subversion of the constitution and suppression of political freedoms – leaves the country ill-prepared to address the many challenges that it faces.

What are the main economic challenges facing Pakistan’s new government?

Over the last three decades, Pakistan has experienced one of the world’s lowest growth rates in labour productivity – a measure of goods and services produced by workers in a given time, and a key indicator of economic performance and living standards.

The country is also mired in a debt trap, with significant amounts of policy-makers’ time spent securing short-term rollovers of external debt year after year. The damaging effects of repeated bailouts from external partners are at their peak – what economists refer to as ‘moral hazard’, whereby the government has few incentives to reduce its exposure to risk as it does not bear all of the costs.

What’s more, the erosion of trust between the people and state institutions continues to exacerbate an already precarious situation. This took root almost immediately after Pakistan was born in 1947, due to frequent military takeovers, their implicit or explicit validation by the courts and subsequent suppression of social and political freedoms.

To borrow from Kenneth Arrow, a Nobel laureate in economic sciences, ‘It can be plausibly argued that much of the economic backwardness in the world can be explained by the lack of mutual confidence’ (Arrow, 1972).

It may seem that Pakistan has finally hit rock bottom with nowhere to go but up, except that the ‘rock’ keeps sinking.

What’s happening with labour productivity?

Pakistan’s average annual growth in labour productivity between 1990 and 2018 has been as low as 1.33%, according to data from the Economic Transformation Database, ETD (Pirzada et al, 2024). In stark contrast, labour productivity has grown at an average annual rate of 3.88% in Bangladesh, 4.72% in India and 8.12% in China.

Part of labour productivity growth in an economy is due to workers moving from less productive sectors to more productive sectors. In the case of Pakistan, if we only consider the growth in labour productivity due to improvements within sectors, the average annual growth falls to the abysmally low level of only 0.73% (using the same analysis as Timmer et al, 2015, and de Vries et al, 2015). The comparable annual within-sector labour productivity growth rates for Bangladesh, India and China are, respectively, 2.11%, 3.38% and 5.90%.

Figure 1: Change in labour productivity in Pakistan, 1990-2018

Source: Economic Transformation Database, release February 2021

The picture appears even bleaker when looking at labour productivity changes across sectors over the same period. Unlike its South Asian peers, labour productivity in Pakistan has either fallen or stayed the same across six of the 12 sectors in the ETD database over the past three decades – namely, mining, utilities, transport, real estate, construction and trade.

A closer look at the data shows that the small amount of growth that we do see is in non-tradable manufacturing and services sectors, which generally have limited potential to deliver high growth in the future.

Figure 2: Growth in labour productivity in Pakistan by sector, 1990-2018

This poor performance in terms of improving labour productivity is closely tied to Pakistan’s inability or, perhaps, unwillingness to benefit from the wave of globalisation that has helped many developing economies to sustain high growth in recent decades. Research shows how ‘exclusion of a country from trade reduces productivity growth, with large long-term effects’ (Alvarez et al, 2013).

Figure 3 uses data from the Asian Development Bank’s Multiregional Input-Output (MRIO) database to plot a standard measure of trade openness and a measure of participation in global value chains for 62 countries. We make a distinction between export and non-export sectors, where export sectors are defined as those that account for at least 10% of a country’s exports. Pakistan does poorly on both measures of trade integration.

An unsustainable external debt servicing burden

Failure to undertake the necessary reforms to improve labour productivity has resulted in policy-makers relying on external debt to deliver brief periods of prosperity in Pakistan.

Yet excessive reliance on external partners to sustain growth has led the country into a debt trap. According to data shared by the State Bank of Pakistan, as of January 2024, Pakistan’s external debt servicing burden for the next 12 months equals almost $29 billion.

That is almost 45% of the country’s expected dollar income – in other words, income from exports and remittances. This is up from 12% in 2011 and it is one of the highest debt burdens in the world.

Figure 4: Pakistan’s external debt servicing burden

Source: State Bank of Pakistan

The last time that Pakistan was in a comparable situation was in the years from 1998 to 2001, when the external debt servicing burden as a percentage of the country’s dollar income had increased to 40%.

Economic growth only returned after the massive debt restructuring that happened once Pakistan decided to join the United States in its war in Afghanistan. In the following two decades, while the economy did experience several episodes of high growth, these proved unsustainable and left the country with similar levels of debt burden from which it had escaped around 20 years earlier.

Pakistan’s journey back into the debt trap matches closely with what has been dubbed ‘the paradox of debt’, where ‘heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs) became heavily indebted after two decades of debt relief efforts’ (Easterly, 2002).

This could be due to factors including ‘profligate government, political instability, or interest group polarization’, which are unlikely to go away because of debt relief or continuous provision of soft loans offered on generous terms, known as concessional financing (Easterly, 2002).

More recent research shows that the debt servicing burden across several other developing economies – both large and small – has also returned to levels last seen in the early 2000s (Rogoff, 2022).

How have multilateral financing and bailouts from bilateral partners become a problem?

Several World Bank officials are on record chiding Pakistan’s elites (and rightly so) for not prioritising reforms. But an important overlooked factor is the very role of multilateral and bilateral partners in providing a steady stream of concessional financing for questionable initiatives or against dubious targets.

A Pakistani economist who has extensive experience of working with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and national governments has long questioned the efficacy of concessional financing. Recollecting his own experience, Nadeem ul Haque wrote in 2002: ‘In one case, I recall a donor team take the easy approach of merely recording all that government had to say perceiving the ill-conceived laundry list of projects to be domestically-owned policy agenda.’

More recently, a similarly ill-conceived set of projects was funded by China under the umbrella of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) – a Chinese-funded infrastructure network that is being built in Pakistan – further contributing to the debt crisis facing the country.

An extensive network of motorways and expensive energy projects with returns guaranteed in dollars were funded under the CPEC initiative in the hope that these would pay for themselves through increases in exports. As widely expected, and in absence of meaningful reforms, this has not happened.

Today, Pakistan generates 50% more electricity than what it needs in months when demand is at its peak. But the contracts require that taxpayers must pay for the generation capacity even when it is not used.

As of September 2023, multilateral and bilateral debt together accounted for 86% of total external debt held by Pakistan’s government.

The country’s default risk, which peaked in 2023, has come down more recently, but only due to the collapse in economic activity that has generated enough surpluses to service interest payments. Nonetheless, the default risk remains one of the highest in the world.

Without absolving the policy-makers of their responsibility, it would be fair to say that: ‘The official lenders should then bear some of the blame for financing bad governments who pursue policies detrimental to their own citizens’ (Easterly, 2002).

The phoenix that doesn’t rise

Stefan Dercon (former chief economist at the UK’s Department for International Development, now merged with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office) describes the current situation in Pakistan as unsustainable, and he urges stakeholders to coordinate efforts towards a better outcome for the country.

As the recent elections show, an increasingly young population that has little to cheer about is demanding representation. This is particularly stark in a polity that is managed by the military and supported by the landed elites and business groups, which have gone to great lengths to protect their rents under the guise of protectionist policies and institutionalised corruption that allows the transfer of public resources such as land to government officials, including judicial and military officers.

Yet so far, the only consensus that has emerged in the relevant circles is an expansion of the role of the military in both politics and the economy, and the use of oppression to subvert democratic freedoms.

Under the guise of fast-tracking foreign direct investment, a new body – the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) – has been set up. This gives the army chief an explicit role in managing the economy.

The Economic Advisory Group (EAG), a Pakistani thinktank with which I am affiliated, has called this move ‘a wrong step at the time of [a] worsening investment climate’. The EAG has further argued that the ‘arbitrary powers given to the council will create more uncertainty for businesses planning to enter Pakistan or expand their existing operations here.’

In the last 12 months, more than 100,000 acres of public land has either been handed over to entities affiliated with the military or is in the process of being handed over in the name of ‘modernising agriculture’.

But relative to average productivity in the rest of the economy, labour productivity in the agriculture sector is one of the lowest in developing countries, including in Pakistan (Pirzada et al, 2024).

As a result, and in line with broader research in this area, Pakistan will benefit if it revisits policies that prevent resources from moving out of the agriculture sector. Yet in sharp contrast, policy-makers in Pakistan are reallocating resources to one of the least productive sectors of the economy.

The transfer of public land to entities affiliated with the military is equally problematic. The Competition Commission of Pakistan has already highlighted how the predominance of military-led organisations in the construction industry undermines competition. In the past, millions of acres of agriculture land had also been transferred to the military.

A Pakistani researcher, Ayesha Siddiqa, in her book, Military Inc., documents that 11.58 million acres of agriculture land was controlled by the military as of 2007. What’s more, 60% of this land was distributed to military personnel for personal use. The 11.58 million acres accounted for 12% of state-owned land at the time.

Researchers have argued that contestation of power by disenfranchised masses has the potential to lead either to democratisation or to more repression by the ‘elites’ to prevent democratisation (Acemoglu and Robinson, 1999).

As the young revolt and fight for representation in Pakistan, the outcome remains uncertain. The ashes are there, Nero fiddles, but the phoenix is yet to rise.
